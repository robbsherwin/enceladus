Enceladus was created by Robb Sherwin for the 2019
Interactive Fiction Competition. To play more of
my games, please go to https://www.joltcountry.com/games

The Windows version of Hugor, which is used to run the game,
is included. But versions of Hugor exist for OSX and Linux.
You can get the latest version of Hugor for all platforms
here: http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Hugor


Basic game commands:
TRANSCRIPT ON/OFF For saving a transcript of play
RECORD ON/OFF For recording the inputs used during play
SAVE GAME To save the game in progress
LOAD GAME To load a previously-saved game
NP For "now playing" - tells the name of the song currently playing
HELP - for a menu of info regarding the game.

The two commands I should note to clarify in-game actions are:
TALK to person: this starts a conversation between Ja'Rod and someone
SCAN: This lets Ja'Rod use his X-ray specs to scan rooms.
