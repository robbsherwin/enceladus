Finnian O'Connell: The pilot 
Mr Mailx: the ship's robot. Based on Grimes's personality. 
Grimes: the really fat geographer who dies right away



A werewolf is lose on the HMCS Plagoo. 

Use some influences. Use some tropes. Make a quick short fun game and get your name out there again. 
The scary part of that Firefly episode was when Serenity almost got taken over. What if some guys tried to board the Plagoo and
they used a werewolf and had to crash land it on Enceladus?

* Flush out the airlock scene
* Riggs McGrathley brought the genetically modified werewolf onto the Plagoo because it would create havoc
* McGrathley states that he had had this beef for a while and is finally going to squash it
* Finnigan uses a star pistol to melt a hole in the hull. McGrathley stays put due to his steel boots. The werewolf goes flying into space. 
* Finnigan crash lands the ship, McGrathley jumps back to his ship because he feels the Plagoo people are insane
* They need some metal and a doctor for Shelley 
* They find an upscale bar that is supposed to be frequented by doctors
* Ja'Rod cuts himself to find out who a doctor is 
* (We practice giving Mr Mailx commands)
* The doctor and Finnigan go to help Shelley and says there is a raw materials mine a little ways away
* The Captain, Mr Mailx and Ja'Rod go into the mine and can get silver and aluminum (or whatever to repair the ship's exposed hull)
* Ja'Rod has the only star pistol 
* They get a transmission from Finnigan that the werewolf and McGrathley is back
* The Captain steals a dune buggy, Ja'Rod can ride Mr Mailx back to the ship
* They go back to the ship but are outside where the werewolf and McGrathley are
* Ja'Rod can melt the silver on Mr Mailx's hand
* Mailx, kill werewolf
* The Captain punches McGrathley in the neck, stunning him 
* Ja'Rod can shoot McGrathley's steel boots, melting them and holding him in place
* Finnigan brings the ship up and squashes McGrathley
* (Pun about squashing the beef after all)
* Go back inside. Shelley is okay. She drinks a half bottle of vodka and the game makes you hit wait 5 times. 
* The doctor says they're all insane and leaves. The crew is together. End of game. 







To do:

They leave the Captain's quarters and find the geographer's body ripped apart and mutilated. 

* Ja'Rod: Grimes was engaged to be married when we got back to Earth.
* Finnian: "They were gonna play Canon in (Mickey) D's when he walked down the aisle." 

The Captain tells Finnian to get to the bridge and take the ship onto the closest moon.
The Captain tells Ja'Rod to go find Shelly and bring her to the bridge. 

***

Ja'Rod gets two steps towards the elevator when he's hit over the head with a blunt instrument and knocked out. 

***

He finds himself in a control room outside the garbage area of the ship, where they flush the trash out into space.

The antagonist, a six-foot tall humanoid with a horse's head is screeching into the PA system.  He -- EQUINOX -- has returned
from the moon she exiled him to. He has the werewolf on a chain. 

Mr Mailx and Shelly are there, and Equinox asks Ja'Rod to say the name of the one that is going to be flushed into
space first. 

Mr Mailx is wider than the hole leading out into space, so if Ja'Rod picks him, it will save Shelly. Otherwise, Shelly gets
flushed into space and killed. 

The Captain appears through a glass window on the opposite side of the trash area. Equinox just starts freaking out
at that point, but one turn later Finnian has crash-landed the ship on Enceladus.

***

Ja'Rod wakes up to see Equinox take off in the ship's escape pod. The werewolf is long gone. 
Equinox gives him the finger and laughing at him for being trapped on the shithole Enceladus, to see how THEY like it. 


Finnian states that we need a new goddamn wall where he planted the ship. If she's still alive, Shelly is too injured to make the trip
into "town" on Enceladus. The Captain gives her a star-pistol and tells her to hide and shoot anyone who approaches 
her. 

Ja'Rod, Finnian, Mr Mailx and the Captain therefore need METAL for the wall and a DOCTOR.
They need to get them both before Equinox comes back and lasers the shit out of all of them. 
(If Shelly is killed, then Mr Mailx got hurt real bad, but can still come with. He still needs a DOCTOR then.) 

* Finnian states that if it's called Enceladus City, there's bound to be tons of shit there they can purchase. Only it's misnamed and very small. 


*** 

They travel a few kilometers and see the "city." It's tiny. 

They argue before going into Mr. Boston's Tentacle Fun Bar. 
* Finnian realizes that it's August 28, discovery day, and everyone is going to be drinking. 
* "It's amateur night," he says. "A bunch of people who have never done it before trying it for the first time."
* Mr Mailx says, "Anders Breivik said the same thing about Martin Luther King Day, since they only got one guy."
* "Turn him off!" says Finnian. 

* The Captain doesn't care, she's going to go in there and get a doctor. 
* As soon as she opens the door, she's knocked backwards by an explosion, leaving the boys to decide who goes in there. 
* There is a scene where they pick straws, only Finnian doesn't cut a small straw. He is too stupid to understand that.
* Ja'Rod is the one to enter.

***

It's a coffee club. On Enceladus, everyone is cold all the time. Warm beverages have replaced beer. 


*In order to find out who a doctor is, Ja'Rod is gonna shoot or cut someone. He says to the player, "What's the fastest way to find an emergency room surgeon?"
* There is a knife on the bar.
* Ja'Rod can cut himself or one of the other patrons. 
* This is a chance to have some background ambience with other humans.

*** 

The doctor helps the Captain up. He was in there drinking caffeine because there's a goddamn werewolf loose on Enceladus. 
He either says he will go back and help Shelly or helps Finnian immediately.
The werewolf is in an underground lair. 

***

Finnian explains that if they go underground, they can get enough material to plug the hole in the ship. It's just ice everywhere else on Enceladus.
The Captain also stresses that they need to kill the werewolf.
Mr Mailx announces that Equinox is coming back for them, intent on blowing up the entire moon. Or at least turning it to rubble. 

** 

The underground lair

Adventuring and exploring. But what can we do down here? A "maze" maybe? 
The werewolf has them all bound. Mr Mailx is turned off. If they say a word, they will die.
Ja'Rod does a "say Mailx" and turns him on. 
Mr Mailx punches the werewolf in the neck and kills him with his silver fist. 

** 
They return back to the ship 

**

Ja'Rod fires x-rays at Equinox's ship, blowing it up and saving Enceladus.
