A werewolf is lose on the HMCS Plagoo.

Ja'Rod Butler: the protagonist. X-ray astronomer, junior science officer.
The Captain: She is a beautiful woman with a bobcut. (Unclear when we reveal her actual name in the game. )
Shelly McKenzie: The life support technician
Finnian O'Connell: The pilot
Mr Mailx: the ship's robot. Based on Grimes's personality.
Grimes: the really fat geographer who gets launched into space
Werewolf: just really in because of the drama
Riggs McGrathley: The antagonist, the game is written as if he had a previous history


A werewolf is lose on the HMCS Plagoo.

Use some influences. Use some tropes. Make a quick short fun game and get your name out there again.
The scary part of that Firefly episode was when Serenity almost got taken over. What if some guys tried to board the Plagoo and
they used a werewolf and had to crash land it on Enceladus?

room BeforeTheAirlock "Before the Airlock"

Riggs and the werewolf are closest to the wall. Mr Mailx is next and at the far end is Shelley. Shelley is bleeding.
Captain whispers to Ja'Rod to fire the pistol at the wall as soon as she snaps her finger. (There is a sizable cool down for it)

daemon 1
  McGrathley states that he had had this beef for a while and is finally going to squash it
  Riggs talks to the Captain about how this is revenge for getting the plutonium transport job the year before

daemon 2
  Snaps her finger, Ja'Rod has one turn to fire the pistol at the wall
>shoot or shoot wall
  Hole in the hull, werewolf goes flying. Riggs goes flying, Mailx fills the hole. Shelley is flung against him.
  Ja'Rod observes that he heard the Captain got the ship by stealing it, thus being ok with shooting holes in it
  Captain tells Finnian to go land the ship.

daemon 1
Captain says they need some metal to repair the hull and a doctor for Shelley

(scene cut, move player)

Location: Outside the ship

(People on Enceladus do shots of hot sauce to keep warm)
* They find an upscale hot sauce bar that is supposed to be frequented by doctors and vets.
>read sign (we are forced to scan it with our eyes before we can get in)
>enter bar

* Ja'Rod cuts himself to find a doctor.
>get knife from Bar
>cut self
(Dr. )
* The doctor and Finnigan go to help Shelley and says there is a mine a little ways away

Location: THE MINE
* The Captain, Mr Mailx and Ja'Rod go into the mine
* down
* down (near the mine cart)
* get the silver and aluminum
(A thunder sound, and the way is blocked due to a cave in)
(Can't use the star pistol due to another cave in)
(Mr Mailx's lights provide the )
(Captain sits down against the wall and just throws her head back with a sarcastic laugh.)
>talk to captain - "Captain ... why ... why do you always seem so sad?"
(Her partner was the ship doctor. They were a team. She was so in love with him. They were lawful. One day,
a pirate lands his fucking (only use of a curse word in the game) ship on top of him. Authorities did nothing. So she
didn't care any more. She went into piracy herself. No, she never found the guy.)

* We buy giving Mr Mailx a command for later
"I can punch through. You just have to tell me," says Mr Mailx.
>mailx, punch rocks >mailx, punch


* Ja'Rod has the only star pistol and the cooldown is almost set
* They get a transmission from Finnigan that the werewolf and McGrathley is back
* The Captain steals a dune buggy, (callback to the beginning) Ja'Rod can ride Mr Mailx back to the ship
* They go back to the ship but are outside where the werewolf and McGrathley are
* Ja'Rod can melt the silver on Mr Mailx's hand
* Mailx, kill werewolf
* The Captain punches McGrathley in the neck, stunning him
* Ja'Rod can shoot McGrathley's steel boots, melting them and holding him in place
* Finnigan brings the ship up and squashes McGrathley
* (Pun about squashing the beef after all)
* Go back inside. Shelley is okay. She drinks a half bottle of vodka and the game makes you hit wait 5 times.
* The doctor says they're all insane and leaves. The crew is together. End of game.





To do:
create PCjr
create "Plagoo"
Am I going to implement WHAT IS and WHO IS?
Pick a conversational system. Christ, just use talk to
create latte/coffee
create door
create doorknob
implement Finnian yelling to be let in if the player locked the door
describe dresser

add glitter to jumpsuit
add banana thong


They leave the Captain's quarters and find the geographer's body ripped apart and mutilated.

* Ja'Rod: Grimes was engaged to be married when we got back to Earth.
* Finnian: "They were gonna play Canon in (Mickey) D's when he walked down the aisle."

The Captain tells Finnian to get to the bridge and take the ship onto the closest moon.
The Captain tells Ja'Rod to go find Shelly and bring her to the bridge.

***

Ja'Rod gets two steps towards the elevator when he's hit over the head with a blunt instrument and knocked out.

***

He finds himself in a control room outside the garbage area of the ship, where they flush the trash out into space.

The antagonist, a six-foot tall humanoid with a horse's head is screeching into the PA system.  He -- EQUINOX -- has returned
from the moon she exiled him to. He has the werewolf on a chain.

Mr Mailx and Shelly are there, and Equinox asks Ja'Rod to say the name of the one that is going to be flushed into
space first.

Mr Mailx is wider than the hole leading out into space, so if Ja'Rod picks him, it will save Shelly. Otherwise, Shelly gets
flushed into space and killed.

The Captain appears through a glass window on the opposite side of the trash area. Equinox just starts freaking out
at that point, but one turn later Finnian has crash-landed the ship on Enceladus.

***

Ja'Rod wakes up to see Equinox take off in the ship's escape pod. The werewolf is long gone.
Equinox gives him the finger and laughing at him for being trapped on the shithole Enceladus, to see how THEY like it.


Finnian states that we need a new goddamn wall where he planted the ship. If she's still alive, Shelly is too injured to make the trip
into "town" on Enceladus. The Captain gives her a star-pistol and tells her to hide and shoot anyone who approaches
her.

Ja'Rod, Finnian, Mr Mailx and the Captain therefore need METAL for the wall and a DOCTOR.
They need to get them both before Equinox comes back and lasers the shit out of all of them.
(If Shelly is killed, then Mr Mailx got hurt real bad, but can still come with. He still needs a DOCTOR then.)

* Finnian states that if it's called Enceladus City, there's bound to be tons of shit there they can purchase. Only it's misnamed and very small.


***

They travel a few kilometers and see the "city." It's tiny.

They argue before going into Mr. Boston's Tentacle Fun Bar.
* Finnian realizes that it's August 28, discovery day, and everyone is going to be drinking.
* "It's amateur night," he says. "A bunch of people who have never done it before trying it for the first time."
* Mr Mailx says, "Anders Breivik said the same thing about Martin Luther King Day, since they only got one guy."
* "Turn him off!" says Finnian.

* The Captain doesn't care, she's going to go in there and get a doctor.
* As soon as she opens the door, she's knocked backwards by an explosion, leaving the boys to decide who goes in there.
* There is a scene where they pick straws, only Finnian doesn't cut a small straw. He is too stupid to understand that.
* Ja'Rod is the one to enter.

***

It's a coffee club. On Enceladus, everyone is cold all the time. Warm beverages have replaced beer.


*In order to find out who a doctor is, Ja'Rod is gonna shoot or cut someone. He says to the player, "What's the fastest way to find an emergency room surgeon?"
* There is a knife on the bar.
* Ja'Rod can cut himself or one of the other patrons.
* This is a chance to have some background ambience with other humans.

***

The doctor helps the Captain up. He was in there drinking caffeine because there's a goddamn werewolf loose on Enceladus.
He either says he will go back and help Shelly or helps Finnian immediately.
The werewolf is in an underground lair.

***

Finnian explains that if they go underground, they can get enough material to plug the hole in the ship. It's just ice everywhere else on Enceladus.
The Captain also stresses that they need to kill the werewolf.
Mr Mailx announces that Equinox is coming back for them, intent on blowing up the entire moon. Or at least turning it to rubble.

**

The underground lair

Adventuring and exploring. But what can we do down here? A "maze" maybe?
The werewolf has them all bound. Mr Mailx is turned off. If they say a word, they will die.
Ja'Rod does a "say Mailx" and turns him on.
Mr Mailx punches the werewolf in the neck and kills him with his silver fist.

**
They return back to the ship

**

Ja'Rod fires x-rays at Equinox's ship, blowing it up and saving Enceladus.

>tell captain about rocks

"\"There's not much and it's not lead. If I had to guess, I'd say it was just ... ice.\"\n"

"\"It. Will. Never. Melt. Unfortunately.\" adds Mr Mailx.\n"

"The Captain, still sitting just smiles and nods. She closes her eyes. And there is just this total non-verbal, existential sadness to her. I mean,
she has seemed like this ever since I rejoined the ship a months ago. But I've never really inquired about the why for her new mood."

>ask captain about mood
"She doesn't open her eyes right away. She's always just so inscrutable, and I'm not always great at reading people to begin with, so I don't know,
I don't even know if I should be asking, but it's like some other force compels me to do so, so I do.\n"

"\"Are you okay, Captain? What happened to you? I know Forburn left, but -- \" Her eyes snap open.\n"

"\"You hadn't heard, Ja'Rod?\" I shake my head in the negatory. No, I hadn't heard what happened to her partner when I was off the ship.\n"

"\"I thought you had heard. You know I don't read the direct messages of everyone on the crew. I think the ship computer supported that, but I
never wanted to know what any of you were thinking anyway. I disabled it permanently when Forburn... he died, Ja'Rod.\"\n"

"\"I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I had sort of thought something like that had happened. I am so, so sorry, Captain.\"n"

"She opens her eyes for the first time and smiles when I say the word 'Captain.' We're a close crew. \"We were bringing blood, actually,\" she says. \"Hundreds and hundreds of
bags of blood to one of the colonies. All the different types. A ... B ... er... \"\n"

"\"A. B.\" adds Mailx."

"\"I said that,\" says the Captain.\n"

"\"Wait.\" I turn to Mr Mailx. \"Are you saying A and B? Or AB?\"\n"

"\"A. B.\" he says. The Captain smiles again, still sitting with her back against the cold wall of the cave.\n"

"\"Forburn had gotten off the ship. We were delivering them to Mimas, right inside the crater, and he had gotten off the Plagoo to talk to our contact
with the government. I was going to join him after running the last batch of tests on the cargo to make sure it was still good. I don't know exactly what
happened. I didn't have a camera or a drone on him or anything. But he got bit by the contact's dog. I don't know if it's because something went wrong
in the deal or if the contact was corrupt or what. When I left the ship and went to the meeting point, I found him dead, his eyes pointed in horror,
dried blood on his cheeks and chest. The dog had a splash of blood all around her, but she was just calmly looking way from him, breathing roughly,
peering out into the cosmos.\"\n"

"\"Oh my God,\" I say. \"That is horrible.\"\n"

"She nods. She closes her eyes again. \"I had to get his body back on the ship... I left the dog on Mimas. We buried him on Earth, we had him cremated, he
said he always wanted that. There was a mixup at the crematorium, I was in so much grief, it was so senseless. I thought I would have forever with him. You know
I didn't say goodbye to him before he left that day? We usually had coffee in the morning, but I was running late. First time in forever and it was that day.
It doesn't seem ... well, he's gone, right? What else can you say?\"\n"

"\"What did you do with the blood?\" I asked. Maybe a bad question with poor timing, but God, nobody gives you a manual for when your boss tells you about how her husband got
murdered.\n"

"\"I dumped it. I just wanted to do something hateful. We left three hours later and I was grieving and I specifically wanted to do something awful. I pushed every crate into the
airlock and pushed the button when we started to fly away. Jupiter's not the only thing in the solar system with a big red spot now, mind you.\" I don't know whether to
laugh at that or not. Suddenly there is a change in her demeanor. Her chin becomes a rock. \"We, Mr. Butler -- \"\n"

"\"Captain, if you want to wait and -- \"\n"

"\"We need to get out of this cave. We have a punching robot that doesn't listen to women and some ice that needs to be punched. Do you care to give him the order?\""





---

"\"We need to land on Enceladus,\" says the Captain. \"It's the closest moon.\"\n"

"\"Where is it? asks Finnian.\n"

"\"You're the navigator, don't you know?\" she says.\n"

"\"I don't just have the positions of all the moons of Jupiter memorized!\" he says.\n"

"\"Saturn. Not. Jupiter,\" utters Mr Mailx.\n"

"\"Right, that's what I mean,\" says Finnian.\n"

"\"Tilt us to port,\" I say. \"Towards the southern cross.\"\n"

"\"Ahhh... the southern cross? The cross? Is that what you mean?\" I don't think Finnian is joking.\n"

"\"The constellation,\" I say\n".

"\"It's just The Cross. Ol' Crux.\" Finnian adjusts something on the ship's navigation console.\n"

"\"No, it's the Southern Cross. It's not visible in the northern hemisphere. Of the Earth. Thus the name.\" Now I'm certain he's not joking.\n"

"\"Wait a second,\" says Finnian. \"You're telling me that God ... GOD, the all knowing and all powerful ... created this piece of religious iconography and then set
it in a hemisphere that Christ never visited? What other star patterns are down there, instructions on how to escape a crucifix?\"\n"
