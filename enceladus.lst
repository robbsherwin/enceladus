That can't be shot!
I can't twirl that now, come on!
I take a sip of my gin-tata. The Kool-Aid tastes pretty fresh, I have no idea where you get Fruit Punch flavor this far from Earth. The Captain consumes her scotch without fanfare, Finnian starts in on his with as much fanfare as humanly possible. Alexandra opens the cap slightly and with a flick of her finger sends it spinning clear across the room. She takes a long pull from bottle of vodka and Doctor Nahas looks at all of us, leaving his drink raised.
\n[Strike any key to continue]
\nAlexandra keeps drinking the vodka.
\n[Strike any key to continue]
\nAlexandra keeps drinking the vodka. The oil melts through the Dixie cup Mailx was holding, creating a mess. Doctor Nahas drinks his ginger ale out of polite awkwardness that Alexandra hasn't stopped yet.

\nAlexandra keeps drinking.
\n[Strike any key to continue]
\nAlexandra finishes the bottle of vodka. Everyone except Mailx is looking in her direction. Maybe he is too. \"I'm parched,\" she says. \"A girl really feels the lack of humidity out here on the Jovian moons,\" she says as Finnian's eyes light up and he gestures in laughter towards the Captain. I look around for something to clean the spill up with as I make myself another drink. We might be a million miles from where we meant to be and ten million miles from where we want to be but at least for the moment we're right where we belong. Together.
\n[Strike any key to continue]
I successfully strike the werewolf in the chest with the silver. The thing about the plastic genetic surgery that these people sign up for is that in order for the Live Action Role Playing to be accurate, they give themselves the weaknesses of the legendary creatures they want to be as well as the strengths.\n
The chunk of silver ore goes right through the sternum of the werewolf, passing through like a metal skewer through marshmallow. The ore isn't even particularly slowed down by the werewolf's flesh and strikes the Plagoo, falling to the ground.\n
The werewolf falls over, dead.
\"... I don't care how bad it is for the Earth, we live a mile up. In fact, I'm going to be throwing my Spray Pam Directly At The Sun Party. You're invited. You don't have to bring anything. Except about forty cans of Pam.\"
\"... The commute is between Phobos and Deimos and takes forever. And where I park on Phobos is near a bunch of bugs. They don't come out until I'm halfway to Deimos and that's why I'd like you to help me out. I'm like a Lyft driver for winged bugs. What? I don't kill them, no. Of course when I land I let them go. I said Lyft driver, not Uber.\"
\"... I don't want to talk about my ex, they say to never do that on a first date. If you insist... ok. He had the Centaur procedure done. Yeah. After we - yeah. Year and a half of dating, I come home to that. You know what's hot once and exactly once? The second Centaur - right. Right. So. What do you do for fun? Please let it not be Dungeons and Dragons.\"
\"... I need a driver. Hmm? Yes, from a Neptunian moon to the Moon. Yes, driving around on the surface as well. What do you mean that's two jobs? What? Driving on the surface of Triton is a separate job from going to Triton to the Moon? Are you trying to screw me? It's driving! Ok. Ok. Ok. Still driving!\"
\"... Yeah, I got tons of it. Not literally tons, it's smaller than Earth. It fell out of the sky. I told you you wouldn't believe me.\"
\"... Protocols changed, if you were still using the old way to encrypt your phone you might as well have been hitting the play button while the bad guys were in the room. Well, I can never remember if it's apt-get or the other way so I didn't personally upgrade, no. I don't have enough money for anyone to steal. Which reminds me. Thanks for the sauce.\"
That's probably not necessary.

\nSomeone enters the quarters, but it's not a werewolf, hell-bent on consuming us all. It's just Finnian, the pilot. \n
\"Dun-dun, dun-dun,\" he sings, doing the 'Werewolves of London' dance with his hands, giving us his profile on each side, mouth wide open to show his incisors. The song has been covered every few years since it came out so we know it, but neither the Captain nor myself react to this. \"Hey Cappie, there's a werewolf on the ship. You banned us from wearing fur, otherwise I would have lasered it, pow!, between the fangs and made a coat out of the part where it didn't ink itself.\"\n
\"No,\" says the Captain, looking painfully at Finnian's chosen ensemble, \"I tried to ban you all from wearing fur-lined banana thongs.\"\n
I wiggle one of my teeth. It's extremely loose. \"That's what you banned? I thought we were banned from eating bananas.\"\n
\"Jesus, Ja'Rod,\" says Finnian with a wince. He turns to the Captain. \"Kid's got a mouth that's craggier than the road leading up to Pripyat Reactor Four. When the werewolf bites him, it'll actually be injecting vitamins into his bloodstream.\"
\nFinnian clears his throat and addresses the Captain. \"Look, do you want us to kill the thing or what? I don't want to get in a situation where it has cornered us and I'm trapped in the rec room with nothing other than that butt-fragile Mouse Trap game for six hours.\"
\nThere's a horrible scream coming from the far, far limits of the hallway.\n
\"Let's go,\" says the Captain. Finnian rifles through her dresser for something proper to wear. \"No more screwing around, you two. Let's get this off the ship before somebody gets killed.\" She unlocks the door.\n
All business, Finnian turns to speak to me. \"Why don't you open the door, kid, and I'll eff up whatever's on the other side?\"
\n\"You'll want to open that door for me, kid, thanks, now.\" says Finnian.\n
\"I don't have the star pistol, Fin, if you were thinking I can shoot something,\" says the Captain. \"It's down in the hold. Just be careful - and Ja'Rod, I'll take out whatever is on the other side when you open the door.\"
\"What killed the lights in the halls?\" asks Finnian. \"I mean, it was probably the werewolf. Grimes had a thing about conserving electricity, though.\"\n
\"He just got engaged,\" I whisper, avoiding looking at the wisps and entrails of Grimes's massive corpse. \"He was gonna get married when we got back to Earth...\"\n
\"Oh yeah,\" says Finnian, poking a flip-flopped toe into Grimes's extensive stomach. \"What, were they gonna play Canon in Mickey D's when he walked down the aisle? Also: Captain. Captain? With Grimes not needing his share can the rest of us get a raise?\" I'm not sure if the Captain heard that or if she did and just ignored it.
\n\"Let's get out of here,\" says the Captain softly. Whatever is out there could hurt Alexandra. (She is our life support technician and her quarters are nowhere near us.)
\n\"Well, the kid took the pistol already,\" says Finnian. \"Not that I had pockets, exactly, Captain.\"
\n\"I can't hide this on me,\" says Finnian of the star pistol. \"Wait. You want me to hide it on me? Where? Are we carrying duct tape in the hold?\"\n
\"No,\" starts the Captain. \"We aren't carrying duct tape in the hold.\"\n
Finnian's face makes about four different expressions before he shakes his head. \"Here, kid, you take it. And don't stare at me, I don't have a lot on to block the x-ray radiation, you know. Ha! Ha ha ha!\" Finnian hands me the star pistol.
\n\"Please lower your specs and perform a \Bscan\b, Ensign Butler,\" says the Captain.
\n\"You look disgusting! Put some clothes on!\" shouts McGrathley. We took a job a couple years ago to deliver two tons of mini chile rellenos from Earth to Mimas. We got the job because McGrathley and his crew couldn't get it done, they couldn't move the merch and we could. He actually fired lasers at us because he lost the deal.\n
\"We put out a distress call as soon as you killed Grimes,\" says the Captain. \"The sector is going to be crawling with cops.\"\n
\"At light speed, no doubt,\" says McGrathley. \"Which, out here in the middle of nowhere... means I have plenty of time to send you all into the icy, inhospitable darkness of outer ... space. The worst torture imaginable!\" The werewolf again shifts just its eyes to look at McGrathley for a beat before settling back on the Captain.
\nThe Captain snaps her fingers, very softly, her right hand having traveled slowly to her right hip. The lighting is very dark in the ship thanks to the attack, so it's really not seen at all by either McGrathley or the werewolf. Not that I expect the werewolf to be focused on signs.
\nCool as can be, the Captain snaps her fingers again.\n
\"No more sarcasm, Captain? No more trying to get your little shots in?\" Technically, it was Finnian who did both of those things, but I keep my mouth shut. I think I am forgetting something but I don't know what.
\nMcGrathley presses the red button on the airlock panel.\n
Alexandra's eyes go wide, she tries to get to her feet, but there is nothing she can do. She is flung into the dark void of outer space. Her eyes go bloodshot, her skin starts to swell. Mr Mailx is also ejected and bounces once into Alexandra, sending them both spinning. Alexandra manages to extend one useless hand towards us before the difference in pressure has sent them spiraling so far away from us that they are mere specs reflecting the dim light of the sun.\n
\"You two!\" screams McGrathley. \"Into the airlock! Oh - and get that one behind the crates!\" Oh no no no the werewolf can see me, it's coming, how can anything leap that far and that fast, no! No!!
\n[Strike any key to continue.]
\nThe Captain joins the rest of us on the bridge. She sits in the command chair.\n
\"How is Alexandra?\" I ask, taking over the scanning station.\n
\"She needs a doctor,\" says the Captain. \"Unfortunately, we don't have a safety valve when the Life Support Tech needs life support.\" She looks over at Finnian. \"Take us down,\" she says.\n
\"Hmm?\" he says, having not paid attention.
\n\"We need to land on Enceladus,\" says the Captain. \"It's the closest moon, closest landing site.\"\n
\"Where is it? asks Finnian.\n
\"You're the pilot, what do you mean 'Where is it?' Don't you know?\" she says.\n
\"I don't just have the positions of all the moons of Jupiter memorized!\" he says.\n
The Plagoo inter-communications panel buzzes. \"Saturn,\" adds Mr Mailx. \"Not. Jupiter,\" he continues.\n
\"Right, that's what I mean,\" says Finnian.\n
\"Tilt us to port,\" I say. \"Towards the southern cross.\"\n
\"Ahhh... the southern cross? The cross? Is that what you mean?\" I don't think Finnian is joking.\n
\"The constellation,\" I say.\n
\"It's just The Cross. Ol' Crux.\" Finnian adjusts something on the ship's navigation console.\n
\"No, it's the Southern Cross. It's not visible in the northern hemisphere. Of the Earth. Thus the name.\" Now I'm certain he's not joking.\n
\"Wait,\" says Finnian. \"You're telling me that God ... GOD, the all knowing and all powerful ... created this piece of religious iconography and then set it in a hemisphere that Christ never visited? What other star patterns are only visible from that side, diagrams on how to escape a crucifix?\"
ENCEL01
Yomaru Kasuga - Blue Danube
\nFinnian sets the Plagoo down on Enceladus. A rather smooth landing, considering the hull breach that is plugged by the robot.\n
\"Ja'Rod, can you please pull Mr Mailx out of the hole in the ship and get Alexandra to the airlock, where it will be warm? Finnian and I will meet you outside where we can discuss the plan thereafter.\" I nod. The Captain seems to be all business, Finnian's joke(?) about the stars didn't seem to cheer her up. She gets like this now, pretty morose at times.\n
There is an exit out of the bridge to the north.
\nFinnian and the Captain get in the lift downwards.
\n(My X-ray specs just automatically went back up.)
\nOkay, Alexandra is in the airlock and both doors are shut. I can head back to the Bridge with Mailx now.
\nOkay, Alexandra is in the airlock and both doors are shut, I just need to free Mailx.
I need to have both airlock doors shut with Alexandra inside.
\n(I need to have both airlock doors shut using the green and red button with Alexandra inside.)
\n\"Hey! You're bleeding all over the place!\" says the bartender.\n
\"You don't have any sort of certification as a trauma surgeon, do you?\" I ask.\n
\"What? No, idiot! Get the hell out of my bar! Moron!\" This, by the way, is the best conversation I've had with a pretty girl in a year, by the way, and I don't think I'm going to get her number.\n
The Captain spins on her stool and stands up, facing the crowd. \"My young traveling colleague is suffering from a terminal case of brain squeezing.\" She points to my specs. \"He has also cut himself, as he lacks the dexterity to manipulate simple tools.\" Jesus. \"Is there a doctor in the bar?\"\n
It hurts pretty bad, but it doesn't hurt nearly enough as it would if I had to get up and make a speech in front of a bunch of strangers. I got off easy, narmean.
\nLuckily, luckily for me, a middle-aged Indian man in a white lab coat that has been splattered with either hot sauce or blood emerges from the crowd and walks up to us. He is either the worst Doctor in the solar system or the sloppiest eater.\n
\"What has your simple-minded friend done to himself?\" asks the Doctor to the Captain.\n
\"Hey man, I'm--\"\n
\"He cut himself,\" the Captain says, \"But look, that's not really what this is about. I've got a ship about a quarter of a mile west of here. One of my crew was assaulted by a stowaway. I think she's in organ failure, can you help us?\"\n
That's a lot for the Doctor to take on, but he seems to comprehend what we are asking. Before I can blink he's given me three stitches and a pat on the head. I guess the splotches were hot sauce.
\nThe Doctor takes a paternal tone with me. \"My name is Milad Nahas. You should be fine, Enceladus is a fairly sterile moon. Do not touch any of the advanced utensils - knife, fork, spork - for three weeks and you should be fine.\"\n
\"Thanks, Doc, I--\" He pats me on the head.\n
The Doctor talks a little more with the Captain, and the Captain presumably uses her charm on the bartender, because the bartender gives her a key, which the Captain hands to me.\n
\"It will get us into the mine,\" she says. \"Let's go.\"
\nIn the distance, just before the horizon, a beautiful jet of water bursts from a warm fracture in the crust of Enceladus. The gaseous plume fizzles into outer space.
\nOh god, god, the second wave is hitting me, I didn't realize there would be a second wave. This is awful, this cannot be how this -- I spastically throw my hands around and start bicycling while in the fetal position on the floor -- \n
\"I'm so - so sorry, I'm aaaaaghhhhh,\" I try to say to the bartender. She just shakes her head and rolls her eyes.
\n\"Give him some milk!\" I hear someone shout from the far corner of the bar.\n
\"That won't help!\" shrieks someone else. \"That's a myth! Idiot!\"\n
\"Give him a slightly mellower hot sauce,\" I hear from the opposite corner of the first guy. Nobody's doing dick to actually help me though, so I don't appreciate these suggestions flying around.
\nI think I'm okay ... for now. I stand. I take a quick glance around the bar to see if anyone has ordered wings, if that's a thing here. I pull on the bottom of my T-shirt to show everyone I'm back and all business again. I'm not sure if that point has been made.\n
\"I'm all business, Captain,\" I say, eliminating all doubt.\n
\"You're telling me she almost went through an airlock?\" asks the Doctor. The Captain nods her head, one professional to another. The Doctor sees that I am standing.\n
\"Ja'Rod,\" he says. \"My name is Doctor Milad Nahas.\" He is speaking really slow in perfect Americanized English, which he doesn't really need to do. \"You ingested too much hot sauce, okay? I'm going to ask you some questions to see if we need to stay here or not. Can you tell me your favorite game?\"\n
\"Yes, it's Mouse Trap,\" I say.\n
The Doctor gives a concerned look to the Captain. He looks back to me. \"Okay, Ja'Rod,\" he says, speaking even more slowly. \"I'm afraid you may be currently suffering from temporary yet severe mental retardation --\"\n
\"It's all we have on the ship!\" exclaims the Captain. \"He's fine, he's no different than any other member of my crew. Look, I have no idea what the criminal that was on my ship did to my life support tech, but as far as I know she's dying in --\" I mime like I am shivering to try to guide the Captain through her speech -- \"Dying in my airlock that was disintegrated open. We absolutely need your help.\"\n
Doctor Nahas stuffs his stethoscope into a pocket. \"Take me there immediately, please ma'am.\"\n
The Captain is talking to the bartender as I stagger to my feet. I get rid of some stuff I don't need. After about ten seconds the bartender slips the Captain something. It's not this huge mystery or anything as to what it was, as the Captain immediately gives me a black key.
\nI can hear \Isomething\i going on up top, I think we all can. But we're down here in the depths of the mine and can't really get back up. The 'something' is quickly revealed as a cave-in.\n
A giant chunk of rock-hard ice falls down the shaft and comes to rest at the exit. We're trapped. Something triggered a terrible cave-in, or ... it seems pretty intentional. Someone doesn't want us getting back up. The Captain taps her jacket to try to raise the Plagoo but just gets static.\n
She lets out a sarcastic laugh and sits down, her back up against the far eastern end of the mine, far from the boulder. She closes her eyes. She looks as I would imagine someone looks who has had one disaster after another and just can't take it any longer.
\n\"Ja'Rod, kill that werewolf!\" shouts the Captain toward me. She whips out the star pistol, which she took from me at some point. She aims it at McGrathley, who is clumsily trying to reload his revolver, apparently being too inexperienced with it to understand that you can load five or six bullets at once.
\nThe Captain calmly produces the star pistol, which she took from me at some point. She aims it at McGrathley, who is clumsily trying to reload his revolver, apparently being too inexperienced with it to understand that you can load five or six bullets at once.
\nThe werewolf is quickly gaining ground and coming straight for me. Fangs out, tongue out, chest completely undefended.
\nMcGrathley fires again, this time somehow missing by an even greater distance. Apparently threatening to throw people out airlocks develops different skills than using handheld weapons.\n
The Captain didn't even flinch.
\nMcGrathley fires again, this time somehow missing by an even greater distance. Apparently threatening to throw people out airlocks develops different skills than using handheld weapons.\n
The Captain didn't even flinch.
\nThe werewolf, with that head start, covers more ground than I would have thought possible and places both of its hands around my neck. It screams in pain for a moment when it accidentally comes close to the silver ore I am carrying, but with one quick swipe it manages to rip apart that piece of my torso and fling it halfway across the universe. The blood comes squirting out of me and without Earth's gravity to bring it back down in a normal fashion, my blood seems to be firing thirty feet into the air. The werewolf digs its other hand into my neck and its nails pierce my flesh, the oblivion comes. It is all over forever.
\nThe werewolf, with that head start, covers more ground than I would have thought possible and places both of its hands around my neck. It makes a slashing motion, causing my blood to squirt out of my head and about thirty feet into the air without the gravity of planet Earth to bring it back down. It's just a stupid genetically engineered monster, just a normal guy that had some work done with all the strengths and weaknesses of the mythical werewolf creature. I try combing my head for anything I could have encountered that would have stopped it, but it digs its nails into my skull, fracturing it into pieces and the last thing I feel or see or smell is my brain going haywire, being unraveled, being strewn about the surface. It ends, thankfully, it all ends, all my problems are gone and it is all over.
\nAfter being targeted twice, to say nothing of having her life and the life of her crew threatened by this unhinged lunatic, the Captain flips the cooldown override on the star pistol, which I didn't even know it had, steadies herself and fires a single shot. The Captain, my hero, quietly and without fanfare hits McGrathley right between the eyes.\n
His body freezes in mid-action, as if possessed by a scarlet ghost, and then disintegrates into a sticky pile of ash.\n
Finnian lowers the boarding ramp of the Plagoo with enough force to cause McGrathley's ashes to scatter into chunks upon the Enceladean surface.\n
The Captain puts the star pistol away as all of us ascend the boarding ramp. I can't help notice that she quickly twirled it one time before hiding it though.
\n[Strike any key to continue]
You have won the game.
\nThe Captain massages her temples.

the Captain's
The computers on the HMCS Plagoo are extremely old, as it's all the Captain could afford after she bought the ship.  This one is a small circuit board with connectors jutting out. 
The Captain has an unread instant message.
\nThere's a message from my fellow crew member Finnian blinking on the screen.
That's too heavy and bulky for me to take!
It's self-booting and just stays on all the time.

It's from Finnian O'Connell, the ship's pilot. I have to steady myself before reading it: in order to protest the temporary pay cut the Captain enforced until things turn around, Finnian changed his instant message font to Comic Sans.\n
\B\Ifoconnell \i:\b there's  a were wolf on the ship

\B\Ifoconnell \i:\b cap, r u there?
\B\Ifoconnell \i:\b i woulda thouhgt that would have gotten more of a reaction tbqh
\B\Ifoconnell \i:\b ok ill come over
Instant messages aren't something people can take with them. Most of them aren't even remotely in anything that approaches English!
desk
It's made of a lightweight plastic and painted a cheap, glossy silver.
I can't take the desk, unfortunately(?).
dresser
The Captain's dresser is a five foot-tall light aluminum storage container that she keeps her clothes in. It has a small dent in one side where it has been struck repeatedly.
I can't take the dresser, unfortunately(?).
bed
She somehow fit a king-size in here. None of us have any idea how she got it past the door. My impression was that she cut away part of the hull. It's pretty old, but mattresses last longer when it's a single female using them. The rest of us got rack upgrades from a RestWell (TM) vendor on Mimas last year.
That's a bit presumptuous.
I couldn't have gotten it in here, I certainly can't get it out!
covers
the bed's
The covers are on top of the bed, you can hardly tell that the Captain slept at all in them. They have a marble pattern, and are officially called a duvet cover set.
jumpsuit
suit
pants
clothes
So, it's a size 4 (US) single piece, bandeau styled for a size-conscious fit. It's got glitter on it, but I don't know if the Captain added it herself or what.
I can't do that.
I take it out of the Captain's dresser.
It would never fit m-- ... it would probably fit me, but I'm still not going to wear it!\n
I should probably just give it to the Captain.
The Captain throws off her long t-shirt and shimmies into her jumpsuit. She produces a latte out of nowhere. (I mean, I wasn't looking when she got changed and everything. I am the only gentleman on this ship. I have a reputation, narmean?)\n
\"I'm ready to communicate with you now, Ja'Rod,\" she says, at last smiling.\n
\"About the werewolf -- \"\n
\"Right.\" She sips from the latte. She seems much more alert. \"With you now.\" She doesn't slurp her latte. She and the crystal 'Mouse Trap' game in the rec room are the only classy parts of this ship.\n
\"I don't know how it got on, but -- \"\n
Someone or some thing enters a passcode to the door from outside her quarters. 
In my horror I realize that \Inobody has locked the door.\i

I'm sure he'd jump at the chance to get extra attention by wearing it, but it's meant for the Captain. I think it's the only way she's gonna focus at this hour.
It's the Captain's!
latte
coffee
angelfish
french
I think the Captain prefers her latte from the Angelfish brewing company straight from beautiful Paris. She brought a bunch of bags with her for this trip.
It belongs to the Captain, though -- she's very particular about her coffee!
It's the Captain's! Taking latte from the captain of a ship is a punishable offense. By my captain, anyway.
long t-shirt
shirt
tee
t-shirt
I've never seen her in it before. Grimes 
(this other crewmember) 
said he caught her raiding the fridge one night, but Grimes sort of camped there a lot. He said it was from someone she cared about a long time ago. That made it definitely not from Grimes.
It doesn't belong to me and can't help with the werewolf problem.
x-ray specs
specs
x-ray
The X-ray specs are glasses that, when lowered, allow me to take a scan of where I am. They work as a miniaturized X-ray machine at that point: the X-ray radiation gives me a view of the world that allows me to see through some walls and some flesh, and the electronics inside the specs give me an understanding of the chemical composition of things that I am looking at.\n
The X-ray specs are currently 
lowered.
raised.
They are essential for me to do my job, I shouldn't be without them.
They are already lowered!
Okay, I've lowered my X-ray specs.
They are already raised.
My X-ray specs are now raised.
star pistol
pistol
gun
weapon
star
There was a wave of retro nostalgia that hit laser weapons about a decade ago. This pistol looks like a atom-for-atom reconstruction of a French Navy pistol, with a curved walnut stock, brass fittings. Somewhere inside are the electronic components allowing it to produce steel-melting laser beams. They aren't the greatest build in terms of quality, the cooldown period is a really, really long time.
I've been tasked with holding onto this, so I probably shouldn't just leave it around.
I twirl the star pistol around my index finger like a cowboy! Haha, I'm a space cowboy!
\n\"Oh my, be careful with that, please, Ja'Rod,\" says the Captain.
I can't possibly take it from her.
I don't feel right just taking it from him.
I already have it!
I thought I already had it.
airlock
The airlock allows us to get things in and off the ship without exposing the entirety of the ship to the cold vacuum of space. Right now there isn't anyone inside. The door to the outside is closed but the door closest to us is open. Mr Mailx and Alexandra are closest to the airlock itself, with the werewolf and McGrathley near the control panel.
The transparent wall of the airlock, the one closest to me, is down. 
The transparent wall of the airlock, the one closest to me, is up. 
The door to the outside is closed. 
The door to the outside is closed. 
Alexandra is inside the airlock right now, which is good - we want her in there so we can control the temperature of that space and keep her warm without having to move her too much.

hull
The hull here is interesting because there are two people in front of it that are not supposed to be on our ship.
I have blasted the hull on the Captain's orders. Mr Mailx, our ship's robot, is currently sealing the hull with its behind exposed to the vacuum of space, plugging it.
I should wait until the Captain gives me a sign!
I emerge from behind some crates and take aim at the section of the hull behind McGrathley and the werewolf. I am shaking a bit, but luckily you don't actually have to be that accurate when blowing a hole in your ship. The star pistol takes a second to warm up after I squeeze the trigger. A ton of ping there. The werewolf probably had enough time to jump over the crates and rip out my neck, but I think it was about to bring up the fact that McGrathley got a spacesuit for himself and not it. Regardless - oh, there it goes.\n
There is a horrible screeching sound as the air and everything else nearby starts to get sucked out by the small hole.\n
The werewolf never had a chance. Being closest, it gets fired through and sent flying into the nothingness of space. McGrathley maybe had an extra half-second, but he was next. He definitely lowered his helmet before he was ejected.\n
\"Don't body shame me!\" shouts Finnian towards our ejected interlopers while all this is going on.\n
I then comprehend the Captain's plan - Mr Mailx was next, but was too large for the pistol's hole. He instead plugged the hole like a Dutch boy's finger. It was all over before Alexandra, clearly injured, even really moved.\n
\"Finnian, Ja'Rod,\" starts the Captain, \"Get over to the bridge, we're going to perform an emergency landing.\"\n
\"Aye-aye,\" I say and get going. Fin does the same.
\n[Strike any key to continue]
Well, I can't shoot it again.
pallets

packages
Those aren't important. Those aren't important to me, I mean. I don't work with the merchandise we might be carting around. I'm an X-ray guy.
So, these are relatively new to the ship, we had some order that required them but something must have happened because usually the pallets go with whatever is being moved. I don't understand how they are just here. Unless the item itself is the pallet and that's what we're shipping. I'll be sure to ask people this if I make it through the next few days without getting killed by a werewolf.
I'm doing that!
No need to do that!

\nAlexandra looks at the open door and then looks at me.\n
She mouths something that I can't hear because the first door is closed.\n
\"She. Is. Saying. Close. The. Outside. Door. Dummy,\" offers Mailx.
\"Close the door, dummy! Red button! It's freezing in here!\"
The door to the outside is now closed.
blanket
It's not really all that important, but I think it's a carbon fiber and silk mesh Snuggie.

console
navigation
The controls are in front of Finnian, they are what he uses to move the Plagoo - to apply thrust, yaw, roll, tilt, all those things I did playing computer games as a kid that I would never dare try in real life. The console is all buttons, though, the Captain couldn't afford the flightstick option for the Plagoo.

intercommunications
This is kind of a speaker placed against the ceiling of the Bridge. Mr Mailx can interface with it at any time. I should be able to as well, but I misplaced my communicator a while ago and I haven't filled out the form in triplicate to get another one. Which is fine, after a werewolf coming onto the ship I don't plan on being alone for the near future!
Captain's chair
chair
The Captain's
The Captain did splurge a little on the chair, the Plagoo didn't originally come with it. It has a giant leather rectangle that forms the back and a couple more for upper back support and a seat. There are a couple of wooden arm rests as well, and two touchscreens beyond those.

scanning
This is the area that I do my work in when I am on the Bridge. My job entails scanning, er, things and getting information. So I've got my X-ray specs when things are up close but there's also a lot of scans I run at this console. Typically I try to get an analysis of other ships when we encounter them but I also provide local weather when we are landing on a planet or, past the asteroid belt, a moon.
bar stool
stool
bar
It's a little tall. Look, I'm above average in height. Okay? And this thing is just making a production of the fact that my feet don't touch the floor and the Captain's don't. Review: negative!!
Thing's a bit tall, isn't it? Look, I'm above average in height. Depending on the source. Okay? And this thing is menacing over me like Carbonite Han in Jabba's Palace. I'd best check it for strings.
I take a seat on the bar stool.
 The Captain joins me to my left.\n
The bartender is a late-twenties Asian gal, I'd place her right in the middle of Los Angeles, California with her horn-rimmed glasses and all business body language.\n
\"Right, fancy a mite o Frank's eh come noe lurves?\"\n
(Nailed it, deep southeast L.A. near Baker, I think.)
Even though the gravity here is lower, my desire to carry around a bar stool doesn't become higher.

They are all huddled together for warmth and conversation. There is low security out here on the moons of Saturn and no videotaping or audio recording, so people inevitably flock here to discuss illicit deals and the like.
I would feel weird just going up to them and starting to talk to them! I don't mind listening to them, but the thought of directly speaking to them is too much for me.
fruit tray
tray
caddy
fruit
\nOn the bar is a small fruit tray.
I am not completely sure what the proper name for this thing is, it's probably not fruit tray.  Maybe fruit caddy? Perhaps the name is regional, like water fountain or bubbler.
\"Hey! Put that down!\" exclaims the bouncer from the entrance. I make a gesture by raising both of my hands to show him that I am not armed, which seems appropriate to me and I assume nobody else. 
I can't take it but maybe I could open it.
knife
It's inexplicably a cheap steak knife that is being used to slice up lemons and limes here. I suspect its main use, however, is in cutting the plastic wrap off hot sauce bottles.
I should sit on the stool and get closer to the bar first.
Taken.
I should sit down first.
I slice, erm. I don't know what it's called. It's near my thumb but not the thumb precisely. Maybe the fleshy part of the thumb? The meaty part of the thumb? The base of the thumb? The heel of the thumb? The butt of the thumb? The pulpy part of the thumb? The muscley part of the thumb?\n
I guess the ball of the thumb, anyway, I slice a three inch gash on my left hand. Blood gushes out and because there's ice all over the floor and on every single surface on this moon it starts to bounce, like it does on hockey rinks.\n
\"Hey!\" screams someone from the back, \"What are you doing?\"\n
\"I've cut myself!\" I say convincingly. \"Ow!\"
I don't know where the bouncer is, I think he's still near the entrance, but I doubt he's going to let me cut other things and people. 
Though if I could somehow inflict an injury, a doctor might come running...

Blair's Ultra Death
ultra
death
sauce
bottle
blair
blair's
hot
Sitting by itself on the bar is a bottle of Blair's Ultra Death sauce.
This particular bottle had been open before, it's missing the keychain with the skull that is attached to unopen ones. It contains about five ounces of sauce, the recipe has not changed in years. The cap is off, missing. It has a white human skull drawn on it. 'FEEL ALIVE,' it says, taunting all who read it.
I can't reach it, I'd have to talk to the bartender to order it.
Got it.
I don't need to do that here, the bottles are always open, baby.
I should sit down first.
I take the Blair's Sauce and turn 180 degrees on the bar stool. I unwrap it and drink the entire thing in one quick slurp.\n
This was a terrible idea, probably the worst idea I've ever had.\n
My eyes start to water, my x-ray specs inexplicably start scanning even though they are on top of my head and I start coughing and hiccuping. This is poison, there was a mixup or something, there is no way anyone could have ever put this into a bottle intentionally. It burns, it's burning through my face!\n
\"Aye pal, one milk then, innit, won ye done wit pure greeting,\" asks(?) the bartender.\n
I can't respond. I'm hunched over dying. This is it, I'm $%^&ing dying. Even the Captain has gone from an arched eyebrow to actual concern.\n
A man emerges from the far booth. \"What did this flailing cretin do?\" he asks. I assume I am hallucinating, but he has a white lab coat and a stethoscope. So great, while this sauce is killing me I ended up finding a doctor either in full Enceladus City Comic Con Cosplay or a porn.\n
\"He ingested a little too much of the hot sauce,\" says the Captain. She puts her hand on my forehead. At first I think she's trying to take my temperature and I feel like that was really motherly of her, but then I realize she was just trying to turn my specs off so I don't irradiate every living bit of tissue in the bar.
\n[Strike any key to continue]
\nThe Doctor rips the two liters of milk that the bartender produced out of her hands and splashes me in the face with it. He forces me to drink about a quarter of the jug. It's not really helping anything past my throat, but I think I'm not dying any more.\n
\"Thanks, Doc,\" I try to say, but what comes out it something more akin to, 'Quaalude Farsase.'
mine
I think it's made out of solid brass or a similarly heavy combo of metals, but it's painted black, the paint having started to chip.
Look, I'm just trying to do a good job here and throwing the key around isn't going to help me accomplish that.
mine cart
cart
It's more of a lift instead of a cart, but regardless three beings can easily fit inside and it would take us up if we wanted to get into it and go that way.
Nobody else seems to want to get into it and I don't want to be weird, so I don't do that.
The three of us hop into the mine cart and are taken to the top ... 
\n[Strike any key to continue]
The mine cart is physically attached to rails in the mine, so I cannot do that.
silver ore
ore
silver
A baseball-sized chunk of silver ore, not the purest thing in the world, mind you, but pure enough for what I suspect will be our purposes.
I don't think dropping the ore is a good idea.
I try to throw the silver ore at McGrathley but he has his weapon ready by the time it softly arcs toward him. He blasts it out of the sky and laughs at his accomplishment in triumph.
She's on my side! How would that help?
I get frustrated with computers as well, but not enough to beat him with some ore!
There is no reason for the snowmobile to be any sort of target for me!
The werewolf is coming at me fast and I panic! I end up accidentally trying a bank shot off the Plagoo!\n
I hit the werewolf in the chest with the silver. The thing about the plastic genetic surgery that these people sign up for is that in order for the Live Action Role Playing to be accurate, they give themselves the weaknesses of the legendary creatures they want to be as well as the strengths.\n
The chunk of silver ore goes right through the sternum of the werewolf, passing through like a metal skewer through marshmallow. The ore isn't even particularly slowed down by the werewolf's flesh and strikes the Plagoo, falling to the ground.\n
The werewolf falls over, dead.\n
\"BZZZT! Ha ha!\" says Finnian through the ship's comm from inside. \"Great shot, Butler!\"
That is not a very good target for me!
aluminum
This is a large chunk of alumnium, which presumably we can use to patch up the ship.
I can't, I need it to help repair the ship.
It's too weirdly shaped to throw!
snowmobile
\nAbandoned just a bit beyond us is what appears to be a broken snowmobile.
Arctic Cat was a company that made snowmobiles all the way back in the 1970s and I think somehow someone dragged one through space and time and then left it in barely running condition, from the looks of it, 70 light minutes away on a Saturian moon.
I don't have any interest in that old piece of moon garbage.
It's too heavy for me to carry, even with Enceladus's decreased gravity!
I couldn't imagine anyone being capable of fixing that old thing.
It's fine!
ice
boulder
There is a boulder of ice here that is preventing exit from the room.
It's impossibly large and dense, too big for me to manipulate or chip away at without freezing to death. It covers the entirety of the way we came in.
It's too heavy for me to personally manipulate.
HMCS Plagoo
plagoo
hmcs
The HMCS Plagoo is a small, saucer-shaped space ship that can achieve 99.99% of light speed to move around the solar system. It is green in color, mostly, somewhere between emerald and seaweed. The Plagoo has yellow accents and the escape module at the top of the ship (that also has retrofitted magnetic tip) is crimson red.
I can't get over there right now.
It's a spaceship, waaay too busy for me to carry.
gintata
gin
glass
container
alcohol
Ah, the gintata! This is a drink of my own invention. You put as much gin into a gallon bucket as will fit and then fill the rest up with a flavor of Kool-Aid. You take a mason jar and dunk it into the bucket and drink it. Have a couple of these  and that's it for you for the rest of the evening, ta-ta.
I raise this perfect drink, this perfect specimen of alcohol with the others before drinking it.
tooth
teeth
Well, I can't save it now. I really gotta start adding limes to everything I eat, though.
thong
banana
fur-lined
Finnian's
I only really take a quick, passing glance. Like I was looking at something in that general direction. Look, this isn't the craziest outfit that Finnian has reported to stand-up with.
Ha! Not on my life!!
dunce cap
cap
dunce
It looks like a traffic cone painted white with the word DUNCE handwritten from the top down. I don't even know where he gets these things, much less why he'd ever want to wear one.
I can't, first he's much taller than I am and secondly I don't really have anything I want to do with it.
fur coat
coat
fur
lynx
It's beautiful, pearl and shade-of-night marbled patterns, runs from the neck down to the ankles. You'd have to be a real prick to order one new. Finnian does check out the antique shops every time we touch down somewhere, so maybe the former, but he also has a current subscription to the 'Skymall' of starships, which is also 'Skymall,' so extra-maybe the latter.
It's too big for me. To take. And to wear. Both, really.
Air Jordans
jordans
air
Size 12 red and white basketball sneakers, presumably re-issues, but considering the other things that Finnian has worn since I have known him, I wouldn't bet on it.
I think the last thing the solar system needs is me contributing to some sort of working, in-progress stereotype of Ethiopian Ensigns stealing space sneakers.
rope
It looks kind of old and weathered, which is odd, as presumably they only shipped new stuff to Enceladus from off-world.
Mouse Trap
trap
mouse
Oh yeah, the pewter Mouse Trap game is here. If anyone asks me to play I'll be sure to have what Alexandra is having. Or maybe a double.
scanner
handheld
It's just a little handheld computer tablet with some listening mods, nothing really out of the ordinary. I assume McGrathley was trying to use it to get into the ship by sending off the wireless key to bring the boarding ramp down.
I am not close enough to get it.

\BIntroduction\b
\nIt is the future.\n
You are Ensign Ja'Rod Butler, returning from an extended shore leave, back on the spaceship known as the HMCS Plagoo.\n
Two minutes ago, you were alerted to the fact that a werewolf has somehow gotten onto the ship. One minute ago you made it into the quarters of the Plagoo's Captain to wake her up.\n
With any luck you'll be able to get rid of the werewolf without it hurting anyone. But, spoiler, check your inventory.\n
You're not carrying any luck.

\BWhat is Interactive Fiction?\b
Introducing Interactive Fiction\n
by Stephen Granade\n
It's been more than two decades since Will Crowther and Don Woods wrote Colossal Cave, the first computer adventure game. Things have gotten complicated since then, what with the proliferation of web sites and the growing number of people using computers.\n
This article is a brief overview of the specific brand of interactive fiction covered by this site, namely, computer adventure games. If you're new to the adventure game scene or want a review of what resources are available for the adventure game player, then read on.\n
Interactive fiction (IF) is a broad term. Strictly speaking, interactive fiction is anything in which you influence the outcome of a story, like continuous stories you can add to or those old \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books with their branching stories. But there is a more specialized meaning of interactive fiction which I use on this site: computer adventure games.\n
In general, computer adventure games are computer programs which tell you a story. In them you play a character in the story, and you move the story along through your actions. In many pieces of IF you have to solve puzzles to keep the story going, puzzles like \"How do I open the locked door?\" or \"How can I get the bridle off the alpaca so I can return it to Barry?\" In some games you also have to interact with non-player characters (NPCs) to keep the plot unfolding.\n
Because IF involves storytelling and puzzle-solving, it tends to emphasize thought over action, a boon for people who like to play computer games but don't like reflex-dependent ones like Quake. If you do like a little action with your thinking, try hybrid games like Tomb Raider, where puzzle solving is blended with jumping and shooting.\n
IF comes in two flavors: graphic and text. Text adventures came first. Playing them is like reading a book in which you have to type commands to tell the protagonist what to do. Famous text adventures include Zork and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is based on the book by Douglas Adams. Graphic adventures tell their stories through pictures rather than words. You may be familiar with graphic adventures like Myst, in which you view the world through your character's eyes, or Monkey Island, in which you move your character around on-screen.\n
If you want to play a graphic adventure, you'll most likely have to pay for it. Most graphic adventures are sold by companies like LucasArts and Cyan, so you'll have to order them from the companies or visit your local software store. Text adventures, on the other hand, tend to be free. If you're looking for a text adventure, chances are you'll find it on the Interactive Fiction Archive. The IF Archive is the world-wide repository for text adventures, and should be the first place you look for new ones. (If you're new to the IF Archive, you'd best read through this guide before going there.)\n
Regardless of whether you want to play graphic or text IF, you should be sure to see what reviewers have to say about the game you've picked. Many commercial game sites review graphic adventures, while the main site for text adventure reviews is Baf's Guide to the Interactive Fiction Archive.\n
If you play IF, sooner or later you're going to get stuck on a puzzle you can't solve. When that happens, there are places you can go for help. Most adventure game sites provide walkthroughs, which are series of step-by-step instructions explicitly leading you through games.\n
However, your best resource for help is other people who have already played the game you're playing. You can talk to other fans of IF on bulletin boards or on Usenet newsgroups. If you're unfamiliar with newsgroups, you can learn more about them at Google Groups, which gives you access to Usenet through the web.\n
There's a lot more out there than what I've talked about here, some of it listed on this site. Don't be afraid to go exploring. After all, playing IF can be entertaining and educational; sometimes, it even aspires to be art.\n

\BAbout the Hugo Compiler\b
\n\BHugo\b is a language designed and written by Kent Tessman for developing interactive fiction.  The system consists of the \BHugo Compiler\b, which compiles source code to be run by the interpreter (the \BHugo Engine\b).
\nHugo is an easy-to-learn, powerful, and flexible language.  The syntax is relatively straightforward, keeping hieroglyphic syntax to minimum.  Hugo is relatively object-oriented, in that a program consists of a number of objects representing the rooms, objects, and characters that make up the landscape of the story.  Interaction between these objects is governed by a set of rules, or routines, that are specified by the programmer.
\nA number of powerful pre-existing routines are available in the \BHugo Library\b, which is a part of the standard Hugo package.  The library routines are designed to manage many of the \"real-world\" aspects of an interactive story, such as weight and containment of objects, the presence or absence of light in a location, doors, vehicles, characters, clothing, and a full complement of player verb routines for moving about, getting things, examining them, opening and closing them, switching them on and off, eating them, drinking them, throwing them, conversing with characters, etc.  By using the library, a programmer need not worry about many of the more mechanical aspects of maintaining the game universe, and can more quickly dive into the writing of the story proper.
\nThe Hugo compiler and interpreter are written in ANSI C, and the source code is readily available; porting of Hugo to other computer platforms is encouraged.
\nHugo is currently available via anonymous FTP from the \BInteractive Fiction Archive\b at \Iftp.ifarchive.org\i in the directory \Iif-archive/programming/hugo\i.  There one may find the executable versions of both the compiler and engine, as well as the library files and a number of Hugo example programs.  A selection of Hugo games is available under \Iif-archive/games/hugo\i.  The Interaction Fiction Archive is also an excellent source of materials relating to the history and development of interactive fiction.

jarod
self
ja'rod
butler
I am a twenty-three year old Ethiopian male, I am 5'9\" tall and I weigh 115 pounds. I have black hair and brown eyes. I am wearing a white T-shirt, blue denim jeans and black Doc Martins for shoes. My hair is buzzed pretty tightly against my head and I am clean-shaven.
The Captain's Quarters, on the HMCS Plagoo
wall
walls
\"Look, Captain, there's a werewolf loose on the ship. We have to go - now!!\"\n
\"Who are you?' she says. \"And where are my pants??\"\n
Ah, cripes!\n
I'm in the Captain's Quarters of the HMCS Plagoo. She has the biggest room not because it's her ship, but because we all figured out pretty early that she would be the only one who would clean it. She has a dresser and computer and, along the starboard wall, her bed.
The Captain's living quarters has two deep gray walls and two light blue walls. The walls jut out a bit along the northern wall and there is a criss-cross pattern there. Warm lighting abounds, the general vibe she has for her place is one of a cozy retreat for quiet contemplation, normally.\n
The big thing with the Captain's living quarters is that it currently doesn't contain a werewolf trying to gorge itself on any of the crew. That's fairly clutch. The Captain is wearing a long T-shirt, having just been roused out of bed because it's the middle of the night.\n
Her quarters contains a dresser, a computer and (along the eastern wall) her bed.\n
(We're in a space ship 
cruising
flying
headed
 toward Saturn.)\n
There is a door facing west that leads to a long hallway.
I could just talk to him if I wanted to respond to his instant message. (But because he'll think the Captain wrote the reply, I take the opportunity to tell him he's been fined so he has something to enjoy the next time he checks his messages.)
I should read and comprehend the instant message before responding to it, this isn't the comment section of YouTube.
I type a response telling Finnian to get his butt down here. He'll think the Captain wrote it but that's ok! Nobody respects my authority, so I don't mine trying hers. I've never known such power!
hallway door
It slides into the wall with a light touch.
I can't -- there is a werewolf loose on the ship!
I open the door, but nothing jumps out at us. I can't explain the following feeling, but I am compelled to state the obvious anyway.\n
\"Nothing out there,\" I say. \"But it's dark, and --\"\n
\"No, look down, kid,\" says Finnian. \"Grimes...\" Grimes, the geographer we picked up just this week and added to the crew. His body has been ripped apart and slung ten meters down the darkened hall. He weighed at least three hundred pounds, which leaves a lot of biomass to be slung about the floor.\n
I don't need to worry about it any more.
Captain
captain
girl
woman
The Captain
She is ten years older than me, but looks younger, what with being away from the sun for much of her life.  She's six feet tall, has auburn hair styled in a 1920's bob cut and owns a jawline that reveals her position as the toughest person on the ship. 
I am 
% sure she is not a werewolf.

She is ten years older than I am, but looks younger. She is wearing a black leather jacket with an unfastened neck snap, a black turtleneck, a silver belt, black denim jeans and boots. She has a 1920's bob cut, brown eyes and black hair.
I don't have anything to say to her at the moment.
\"Captain ...\" I was going to mention the silver, but I don't. \"Are you okay?\"\n
She doesn't open her eyes right away. She's always just so inscrutable, and I'm not always great at reading people to begin with, so I don't know, I don't even know if I should be asking, but it's like some other force compels me to do so, so I do.\n
\"Wait. You're not okay, are you, Captain? What happened to you when I was gone? I know Forburn left, but...\" Her smile gets broader, but it is lacking all warmth.\n
\"You hadn't heard, Ja'Rod?\" I shake my head in the negatory. No, I hadn't heard what happened to her husband when I was off the ship.\n
\"I thought you had heard. You know, unlike popular opinion, I don't actually read the direct messages of everyone on the crew. I think the ship computer supported that, but I never wanted to know what any of you were thinking anyway. I disabled it permanently when Forburn... he died, Ja'Rod.\"\n
\"I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I had sort of thought something like that had happened but I didn't know. I am so, so sorry, Captain.\"\n
She opens her eyes for the first time and smiles when I say the word 'Captain.' \"We were bringing blood, actually,\" she says. \"Hundreds and hundreds of bags of blood to one of the colonies. All the different types. A ... B ... er...\"\n
\"A. B.\" adds Mailx.\n
\"I said that,\" says the Captain.\n
\"Wait.\" I turn to Mr Mailx. \"Are you saying A and B? Or AB?\"\n
\"A. B.\" he says. The Captain, still sitting with her back against the cold wall of the cave, manages a shrug towards me.\n
\"Forburn had gotten off the ship. We were delivering them to some dump in downtown Mimas, right inside the crater, and he had gotten off the Plagoo to talk to our contact with the government. I was going to join him after running the last batch of tests on the cargo to make sure it was still good. I don't know exactly what happened. I didn't have a camera or a drone on him or anything. But he got bit by the contact's dog. I don't know if it's because something went wrong in the deal or if the contact was just a piece of garbage or what. And it wasn't just a bite, it couldn't have been. When I left the ship and went to the meeting point, I found him dead, his eyes pointed in horror, dried blood on his cheeks and chest. He had been mauled. The dog had a splattering of blood all around her face, but she was just calmly looking way from him, breathing roughly, peering out into the cosmos.\"\n
\"Oh my God,\" I say. \"That is horrible.\"\n
She nods. She closes her eyes again. \"I had to get his body back on the ship... What I hated most about myself is that I knew he was dead and I just switched off and had to get some tasks done and didn't feel anything for that initial moment, Ja'Rod. There was nothing at first. It was like I was being told a fact instead of experiencing it. I left the dog on Mimas. We buried Forburn on Earth, we had him cremated, he said he always wanted that. But there was a mixup at the crematorium and I was in so much grief, it was so senseless. I thought I would have forever with him. You know I didn't say goodbye to him before he left that day? We usually had coffee in the morning, but I was running late. First time in forever and it was that day. It doesn't seem fair ... well, he's gone, right? What else can you say?\"\n
\"What did you do with the blood?\" I asked. Maybe a bad question with poor timing, but God, nobody gives you a manual for when your boss tells you about how her husband got murdered.\n
\"I dumped it. I dumped it out just wanted to do something hateful. We left Mimas three hours after I found him dead and by then I was grieving and I specifically wanted to do something terrible. I pushed every crate of blood into the airlock and slammed the red button when we started to fly away. Jupiter's not the only thing in the solar system with a big red spot now, mind you.\" I don't know whether to laugh at that or not. Suddenly there is a change in her demeanor. She looks at the boulder. She stands up. Her chin becomes a rock. \"We, Ensign Butler -- \"\n
\"Captain, if you want to wait and -- \"\n
\"We need to get out of this cave. I assume it was McGrathley that locked us in here. We have a punching robot that doesn't listen to women and some ice that needs to be punched. Do you care to give him the order?\"
I try to tell the Captain about the werewolf, but I am not sure that she even recognizes me.\n
\"Who - sorry, I can't see anything, it's too early for this,\" she says. \"OK, I know you aren't Grimes, since this conversation is taking place away from the cafeteria.\"\n
\"I know it's not in this room, but that's it, Captain,\" I add.
\"Can you go over the plan again?\" I ask.\n
\"Yup,\" she says, \"We're going to go west. You find a place to hide. When I snap my fingers ... shoot the hull.\"\n
\"The hull?\"\n
\"You got it.\"
\"Captain, how are we going to find a doctor in here?\"\n
\"Let's sit first,\" she says.
\"Thinking about that,\" she says. \"I'm wondering if the money move here is to get one to perhaps come to us.\"
I think she is having a nervous breakdown at the moment.
\"Thank you for everything, Captain,\" I say, glad to have made it through this last caper unscathed.\n
She nods and smiles. She indicates that I should go ahead and drink my gintata.
I don't have anything to say to her at the moment.
Finnian
finnian
o'connell
pilot
He's wearing a fur-lined banana thong, \Ilittle\i else.
He is wearing a lynx coat from head to ankles, a dunce cap and Air Jordans.
\"What do you know about the werewolf?\" I ask Finnian.\n
\"I assume it's a ship malfunction. Maybe you even did it. What is your job on the ship?\"\n
\"X-ray Technician.\"\n
Finnian gives me an unchanged look for five seconds too long. \"Okay, you definitely don't have enough responsibility to have caused this.\"
\"Hey, the Captain's been a little off since I got back from leave,\" I say to him. \"Did something happen?\"\n
Finnian turns to me and stops fiddling with the console. \"You really hadn't heard?\" he says. But we hear people approach the bridge, so that is all he says for now.
\"It's good to see you, man.\"\n
\"Hey, you did good out there, kid,\" says Finnian. \"Now drink up! It's not fun when the rest of us are planning on getting bombed and there's someone in the room who is not, who is all judgy.\" He indicates the robot in that last statement, which I think Mr Mailx understood because he turned to glare at him.
I have nothing to say to him.
Grimes
grimes
harold
p.
Grimes was a 300 pound middle aged white guy that was our geographer. He was going to help us find the right place to land when we took jobs, but that's over and done with now because right now he's dead on the floor in a pool of his own blood, his throat having been ripped out by the werewolf that got on the ship.
Grimes is dead.
He's too big for me to move.
Alexandra
alexandra
mays
Alexandra is a tall redhead, our life support technician. She is usually the life of the party on the ship that people can actually stand, meaning, not a self-serving narcissist like maybe our other ship's extrovert. She is wearing a silver jumpsuit and black moon boots, I think she was on watch when the werewolf stuff happened. She is in a lot of pain at the moment, though I am not sure specifically what Riggs did to her.
She doesn't need to be pulled anywhere! She is not plugging any holes, for instance.
There is no point in doing that.
I don't have anything to say to her at the moment.
\"Are you in a lot of pain? Can you move?\"\n
\"Hey Ja'Rod,\" she says. \"It's not great, the Captain gave me some dilaudid though. I think I'm allergic to it, but that's a problem for future Alexandra.\"\n
\"Time. Travel. Is. Impossible.\" chimes in Mailx.\n
Alexandra rolls her eyes. \"Shot in the appendix by two pieces of space garbage and I can still find software bugs,\" she says.\n
\"Hold tight, Captain said I should get you in the airlock where we can control the temperature until we can fix the ship and get you a doctor. I imagine we're going to go planetside soon.\"\n
\"Enceladus. Is. A. Moon,\" says Mailx.\n
There's a green button and a red button on the control panel for the airlock.
\"You seem like you're feeling better!\"\n
\"Sometimes the old medicine works best, eh?\" she says, tipping the bottle of vodka to you. \"Although seeing the master plan to keep me alive was to put me in an airlock and close the doors, I'm never doubting how important my job in Life Support Tech is ever again.\"
I don't have anything that I can think of right now to say to Alexandra.
Mr Mailx
mailx
robot
Mr Mailx is the robot that Grimes brought onto the ship with him. I am not entirely sure what his function on the ship is supposed to be or going to be. He is just over six feet tall. His torso is made up of three vertically-racked large tower PC cases. He has no head, but a right and left speaker are mounted to the topmost computer. The speakers each have a dull green power LED that aren't eyes, but look like they are. He has tank-like tread on each side to offer locomotion, which is fine, but his arms and hands go weird into the uncanny valley a bit: they are made up of protruding pieces of PVC pipe with red, green, yellow and white wires all around them and inside. His hands are spindly, ethereal - each a Raspberry Pi board with three fingers and a thumb soldered into the board's breadboard pins. 
His fingers are extended out like the wisps of a scarecrow while he is stuck plugging the hole in the Plagoo. 
He is not an attractive robot.
\"All right buddy,\" I say to Mailx, \"Let me get you out of there.\"\n
\"Understood. Agreed,\" says Mr Mailx.\n
I count to three, kind of looking the power LEDs that make up his eyes in good eye contact and grip his wispy metal fingers. On three I yank him out and the cases that make up his backside pop out.\n
\"You okay, man?\" I ask him.\n
\"Will. Run. Diagnostic.\" he says. I nod. 
\"Alexandra, we gotta get you over to the airlock, okay? It's going to get really cold in a bit with that giant hole in the hull, but in the airlock we can at least control the temperature there.\"\n
She doesn't say anything but grimaces a nod to let me know she understood. She's holding her hand against her spleen. Or her liver? Her kidneys maybe. I can't tell how bruised she is, but it's enough to keep her laying on the floor.
I sort of wait a little bit to see if is going to tell me if his diagnostic passed or not, but it occurs to me that it could days or hours to run and I can't do anything to help him if it fails. We had his behind exposed to the vacuum of space, I'd expect a few failing QA tests. Anyway, he's out now.
That wouldn't do anything.
I don't have anything to say to Mr Mailx at the moment.
\"You all right? Hey look, Grimes died. But you can stay with us anyway, we'll take care of you.\"\n
Mailx's LEDs where his head would be flicker a little bit. He doesn't say anything.
I should talk to the Captain a little before talking to Mr Mailx.
\"Mr Mailx, could you please destroy the ice blocking our exit?\n
\"All. Right,\" he says.\n
Mailx attempts a K-turn. It takes about five minutes for him to turn around. He then lines his spindly fingers up with the boulder of ice.\n
His fingers sort of intertwine within each other. I would describe them looking kind of like the end of a drill bit. They definitely come to a sharp point. He then slides them each back about six inches from the front of the boulder. Then he strikes.\n
I guess I've seen videos of martial artists breaking through cement and stone with their bare hands. Mailx has chi, I guess? At some point in the future I will ply myself to enlightenment thinking of how this robot harnessed his inner energy to save us all, but right now, man is it freezing down here. He only needs to strike twice before managing to completely pulverize the ice boulder into harmless rubble.\n
Whoever pushed the boulder down on us used a chunk of aluminum as the centerpiece to it, probably because they wanted to have the same effect as putting a rock in a snowball does. I take it.
\"Thanks, Mr Mailx.
I think he's sulking.
\"Thank you for your help, Mr Mailx. I hope you'll stay with us.\"\n
\"Okay,\" he says, with no more warmth or affection than he had before, which was none. Ah well.
He won't look at me.
werewolf
wolf
man
This thing is a horrible result of an intentional genetic compromise. You can get DNA manipulation of your characteristics fairly cheaply on Phobos but some people take it too far. There are stories of people who have become mermaids and centaurs. I've never seen one up close.\n
The werewolf stands about five and a half feet tall. Thick brown hair juts from every location that hair can grow on its body. It has yellowing fingernails emerging from furry, blackened hands. Two fangs are obviously visible, but they are bright, perfect white. It wears and needs no clothes due to all the hair.\n
Its eyes look a bit messed up, they are bloodshot, cells just bursting with blood, and I don't think it was picked out by him when he did this to himself.
Sure, but with what?
It's too deadly for me to attack directly!
Doctor Nahas
milad
nahas
doctor
Doctor Nahas is a middle aged Indian man with brown eyes and jet black hair. He is wearing a eggshell-colored smock over a cyan polo, grey chinos and fur boots.
I don't have anything to say to the Doctor.
\"I hope you will fly with us for a bit!\" I say to him.\n
\"That seems very possible,\" he says. \"You and your crew have found ways to become injured that I have never seen before. It's like real-life laboratory conditions. I still don't even know what organ was most horribly affected on Alexandra.\"
I don't have anything else to say to him.
McGrathley
mcgrathley
riggs
McGrathley is a mixed race unmodified human that has the world's worst facial hair, which dominates the scene as people look at him. It looks like his face is being slowly mapped for the rest of the colony by twelve fat ants. He wears photochromatic lenses that only sort of work, as we can clearly see his eyes. I'm just glad that someone 
on this ship 
has something stupider on their face than I do.
I should take care of the werewolf first!
I can't really do anything to him directly, but I start waving my hands around to give him something other than the Captain to aim at!
He's much too powerful for me to take on by myself in like hand to hand combat! Plus I don't know any hand to hand combat!
bouncer
He actually looks like Simo Hayha, the Finnish sniper that killed like 500 Russians when the commies tried Zerg rushing Finland in World War II. Because of how the bouncer is specifically dressed, in fact, he looks like the picture of Hayha where he's got the winter coat on and he's looking down the barrel of a gun and he's wearing the face mask with the little eye slits to hide himself (as opposed to later in his life, after the Russians blew away half his face and he brought that mask out to not scare the neighborhood kids when they went Trick or Treating).
\"Hey! Do you know any doctors?\"\n
\"Is that a threat?\" asks the bouncer, starting to rise.\n
\"What? No!\"\n
\"Okay. Better not be a threat,\" he says.
I don't have anything to say to him.
bartender
She is a little shorter than I, in much better shape and of Asian descent. She is wearing a black spaghetti strap tank top, black jeans, black boots and black lipstick. This is the ensemble of someone that has had hot sauce spilled on everything and now avoids color in all its electromagnetic forms.
\"Are you aware of any doctors maybe hitting the sauce at this bar?\" I smile at my little playful adventure with words there. Unfortunately, it just makes me look like a leering, grinning jackass to the bartender.\n
\"Um. No. I don't know of any,\" she says.\n
\"I think this is where I am supposed to slip you fifty dollars to see if it will loosen your tongue,\" I say. But I don't have money, so I can't do that. The bartender looks at the Captain, gives her a single expression that I assume is one woman telepathically telling the other to take care of her own trash, and the bartender turns her back to me.\"\n
\"I, ahh, normally work best with radioactive metals,\" I say quietly to myself.
I should sit on the stool near her first.
\"Hey, can I have the Blair's sauce?\" I ask of the bartender. She gives me a look up and down.\n
\"Have you tasted hot sauces like that one before?\" she asks with an arched eyebrow, having abandoned her accent. Or she adopted mine.\n
\"Oh yeah,\" I say. \"All the time. Ja'Rod Butler, from Scoville, ah--\" I look toward the Captain because I can't think of an American state right now, \"Jersey, that's me. We grew up around it, it was everywhere.\"\n
\"If I give this to ya and you drink it and you throw up in me bar I'm going to be really upset,\" says the bartender.\n
\"Oh man. Do people do that? Just come on in here, taste some sauce and get sick?\"\n
\"No. They don't. Because I specifically ask them and they answer me honestly and truthfully so it never gets that far.\" She hands me the bottle of sauce. I feel a little bad about constructing a lie that is about a million heat units, but I remember that I'm on a mission here, I'm working. (Then I realize she is too, but that's as far as I go.)
Oh, I think I've ruined her night enough for now.
Hallway Module
The Captain's Quarters
There is a brief hallway module connecting the Captain's bedroom (which is to the east) to the hold, which is west. For some reason, the modules are all colored a deep burgundy, which nobody likes, but nobody dislikes enough to change. (The Plagoo has a red magnetic pole installed at the top of the ship, which is how we get away with these compass directions. No longer needing to know terms like port and aft really opened the solar system up to normal people who maybe shouldn't be out here.)
\n\"Not to be a pest, dear,\" starts Finnian to the Captain, \"but do you think we should put some form of self-defense on the solar itinerary?\"\n
The Captain smiles at him without using her eyes. She doesn't directly address him, which is something she didn't used to do, but something I noticed her doing when I came back from shore leave. \"I think Ensign Butler lowering his X-ray specs to give us some help on what's ahead would be the next best tactic,\"she says, genuinely sweetly.\n
Ensign Butler! Oops, that's me, and yes, as the X-ray technician of the Plagoo, I carry some specs with me. I can \Blower my specs\b and perform a \Bscan\b with them.
The Captain smiles humorously. \"I think we're headed on a good path. We've a weapon upcoming in the hold and Ensign Butler has his x-ray specs deployed in the scan position to let us know what's ahead.\" The Captain has a talent for seeming like she's in control of the situation, which is nice, because I don't need augmented vision to know my heart is pounding. Although I guess I really shouldn't stare at human bodies when the specs are engaged for too long.
\"There's nothing out of the ordinary to report for the next room ahead, Captain - no werewolf, nothing particular crazy.\"
Nothing to report here.
Ship Hold
The Plagoo has a small hold right off the Captain's bedroom, and this is it. The original owner of the ship didn't trust his crew with the cargo they ran with. Our Captain does, but the Plagoo can't exactly be reconfigured.\n
The hold itself normally has poor lighting, it's even worse now that lighting systems have apparently been damaged. It's rectangular in shape, maybe ten feet wide and fifteen feet long. The walls were painted a deep maroon like much of the rest of the interior at one point. There's a great deal of pallets stacked on both sides.
\nThe Captain opens one of the packages on top of a pallet to my right. It's an unopened star pistol. She unboxes it, avoids cursing at the tight plastic grip keeping the pistol in place and inserts the battery into the grip with a solid 'thwack.' She hands it to Finnian.\n
\"Let me do the talking if it gets that far, I've got an idea what is going on,\" she says to Finnian. \"I'd say don't draw attention to yourself, but, well.\" She gestures at the hammock. \"Keep the pistol hidden.\"
\nExits lead west, further into the ship, and east, back down the hallway where we came.
I can go west and east from here.
I can see ahead that there's actually two people waiting for us in the next area.\n
\"Captain, I'm seeing two unknown forms and what I think is Alexandra.\" Alexandra is our naviagor and the life support tech. \"Alexandra seems to be in the fetal position next to the air lock. One of the forms definitely looks like the silouette of a werewolf. The other form standing next to it is taller, has lead boots. No weapons that I can detect. I also think that Grimes's robot is there.\"
\n\"Good work,\" says the Captain. \"Let's proceed.\"
I should wait for the Captain to tell us to proceed instead of just running into trouble.
 Not trying to be the softest serve on the ship, it's just that this is a learning experience for me, regarding werewolves on the ship.

I can't go that way yet. The Captain wants me to lower my X-ray specs and perform a \Bscan\b so we can see what's ahead.
Monitoring
This is one room before the airlock, where I saw two figures next to Alexandra, who is part of our crew, and Mr Mailx, who is the robot that Grimes got working.
\n\"This is what I'd like us to do,\" says the Captain, \"when we proceed to the airlock up ahead. Finnian, I would like you to accompany me as we talk to our interlopers on the ship. Ja'Rod, I would like you to stay hidden and shoot the hull behind them when I snap my fingers.\"\n
Finnian nods, the disposition he normally carries about has left for a moment. After all, there are enemies on the ship and we can still save Alexandra. I have a few thoughts - why not shoot the werewolf and the other guy instead of putting a hole in the ship, but I just nod as well.
Before the Airlock
I'm before the airlock again. Mr Mailx is here plugging the hole I created. Alexandra is conscious, but laying on a blanket that the Captain somehow produced. 
(I'm hidden behind some cargo crates, but nobody else is.)\n
We are in a narrow hallway, there are monitors mounted a couple meters high in both directions. Inside our airlock is Mr Mailx and Alexandra. Outside of the airlock is the werewolf and someone I don't recognize. The Captain and Finnian approach.\n
\"Captain!\" says the unknown figure. \"How nice of you to join us. I plan on sending every member of your crew out the airlock.\"\n
\"How did you get onto my ship?\" the Captain asks.\n
\"Through the airlock. The other way. It seems you sent the unencrypted wireless key to Grimes when you hired him, and Grimes failed to secure his communicator.\"\n
\"You came in through the airlock on the opposite side? Without that thing wearing a suit?\" She points to the werewolf.\n
The werewolf's head is still pointed toward the Captain, but it turns bloodshot, vacuum-afflicted eyes towards the man after that for a long second before settling back onto the Captain and Finnian.\n
\"It can take it!\" the man hisses. He notices Finnian for the first time. Desperate to change the subject, he addresses Fin. \"What are you wearing?\"\n
\"Appropriate dress in this area of the solar system for shore leave, McGrathley,\" he says. McGrathley! I didn't recognize him in the spacesuit, but this is Riggs McGrathley, a pirate we've encountered once before.
I'm hiding behind some crates in the room before our airlock. 
This room is before our airlock and it's got a few scattered crates and a control panel along the portside wall.
Not a great place to do that.
I can't really leave right now.
I can go south back to the Bridge.
I can't go that way right now.
I can't go that way right now.
Bridge
Finnian and I run back to the helm on the Bridge. The Captain stayed to check on Alexandra. Finnian doesn't ever really start any conversations with me. After working with him for two years and then a year break and then the last few weeks I have no idea if he likes me or not. It always seems like I am bothering him working when I bring up non-work topics, and it always seems like he thinks I'm tedious when I bring up work at any other time.\n
\"That was crazy, huh?\" I say. Why not, what can it hurt.\n
\"Well, the best part of that plan is that it would have also worked with Grimes's fat ass in the breach, not just his robot.\" Former employee bashing! I guess I'm off the hook for a bit.\n
Finnian sits down and starts fiddling with the navigation controls.
This is the Bridge of our ship, there's a chair in the middle of the room for the Captain. Finnian has a navigator's console before a large black high definition television. I have a station behind the Captain port side.
\nI hear the Captain via the communications system on the Plagoo.\n
\"Ensign Butler,\" she says, \"How is Alexandra?\"\n
\"Alexandra is inside the airlock, the temperature controls are active and she'll be safe there. That room is getting cold.\n
\"Very well. Let's meet outside for our next steps.\"
\n[Strike any key to continue]
There is an exit north to the hall but I shouldn't leave my post at the moment.
There is an exit north into the hall.
I should stay here in the Bridge for a bit.
Port Side Hallway
This is just a simple access hallway that allows me to get to different areas of the ship.\n
I can tell that Finnian has completed the ship landing procedures, there is a whirring and clicking and sounds of orchestral strikes. (Some of the latter may simply be that Finnian is force-piping the album Big Generator through the ship's audio, however.)
This is just a simple access hallway that allows me to get to different areas of the ship.
Just the whirring of the ship itself and 
'Love Will Find a Way.''
'Rhythm of Love.'
'Big Generator, the single.'
'Shoot High Aim Low.'
'Almost Like Love.'
'Final Eyes.'
'I'm Running.'
'Holy Lamb.'
PortSide Hallway
To the north is the airlock and to the south is more hallway.
To the south is more hallway, but eventually the bridge.
I don't have any reason to go back that way, I should go back towards the Bridge.
Outside the Plagoo
Finnian looks around before looking back toward the group. He changed before we came down, now wearing a real Lynx fur coat, a white dunce cap and new old stock original Air Jordans. \"Crap, Captain, it's an ice planet!\"\n
She nods at that. \"Intelligence indicates that there's a small town a kilometer east of here. There's a mine, which we need, and a kind of bar.\"\n
\"What's your source of that intelligence?\" asks Finnian.\n
The Captain grits her teeth. \"I consulted Wikipedia. Okay? Is that all right?\"\n
\"No it's not all right!\" says Finnian. \"Wikipedia's moderator and administration system is filled with duplicitous losers that turned the exchange of free information into a political battle where scumbags scuttle into tribes to spread their lies. Mr Mailx?\"\n
\"Yes,\" he says.\n
\"Delete the Wikipedia page on Enceladus and replace it with a 10K image of a giant tarantula.\"\n
\"Finnian, stop,\" says the Captain.\n
\"Done,\" says the robot, presumably having fired off some API calls.\n
Finnian laughs. It's a dry, hollow one. \"Seventy one minutes from now, good luck to any kid trying to do a book report on Jovian moons. Cite that revision in your bibliography, you sniveling Webelo punks.\"\n
The Captain walks east. Mr Mailx starts up to join her and after a shrug and then a replacing of his precariously-set hat, Finnian goes east too.
McGrathley and the werewolf are here, it appears that they are trying to hack into the boarding ramp of the Plagoo in order to board it.\n
Upon seeing us, they put their handheld scanner away. The werewolf begins snarling, having recognized us, but it is waiting for a command to strike.\n
\"The cave-in should have crushed you, Captain,\" says McGrathley. \"Enough, I'll just kill you myself.\" He produces a revolver, an old fashioned six shot. The Captain disembarks the snowmobile and slowly begins walking toward him.\n
McGrathley fires once. The bullet misses the Captain by about twenty feet and reaches escape velocity, leaving Enceladus until it is presumably captured by the gravity of Saturn.\n
I roll off the snowmobile and stand towards the Plagoo. The werewolf begins scrambling toward me.
I am outside the HMCS Plagoo, although the ship is locked and the walkway up is closed. The other three members of my party have gone east. This is my first time on Enceladus, the sixth moon of Saturn. The gravity is a lot lower than Earth or the ship, although a injector has been installed in the moon's core to give it a little more pull than it had naturally. Virtually the entire surface is covered with ice, or (where people have set up civilization) crushed ice.
Snowy Path
\"... I'm just saying, have you ever tried to edit something on it? No? Oh, hey Ja'Rod,\" says Finnian.\n
\"Our plan is going to be this,\" says the Captain. \"There's a hot sauce bar up ahead. To the east. We ask around to find a doctor. Since we also need to repair the ship, let's see if we can find a mine.\"\n
We all nod at this except for Mr Mailx, who just keeps treading east with a low whir.
I am on a snowy path towards civilization on the moon Enceladus. My goal from here is to go east and join up with everyone.
\"... bring her back something to drink is all I'm saying, they can't just have hot sauce. Maybe a bottle of scotch to anesthetize her wound. Hey robot, does scotch kill the bacteria and germs around wounds?\"\n
\"No,\" says Mr Mailx.\n
\"What does he know, he spends his free time vandalizing encyclopedias,\" Fin says.\n
\"What do you think the word anesthetize means?\" asks the Captain, who is still walking. For the first time I understand what Finnian has been trying to do lately, he's trying to \Bcheer her up.\b It isn't working, because he's a socially maladjusted narcissist, but he's trying.\n
\"Ja'Rod,\" she says, \"Can you give me a scan of what is up ahead?\"
So, where we happen to be on Enceladus is a place that is on the opposite side of Saturn. I have heard it's a bit overwhelming when you're on the other side of the moon and Saturn is there looking at you like a giant angry god. The way Enceladus moves in its orbit, we won't ever get that view which is bad from a life experience standpoint but better from an anxiety-inducing one, I think.\n
The ground is pure ice here. It isn't clear to me if humans or machines have ever truly walked on this particular part of the moon ever due to just how slippery it is. The path to town is to the east.
There are exits east and west from here.
\"I see giant spiders, tell Mr Mailx to take some on location shots for the next batch of edits,\" I say, trying to keep the conversation going. \"No, for real though, there is, sure enough, a bar not too far away and it's across from the entrance to an underground mine. I'm not getting good readings on what sort of metals are down there, so I assume it's lead and something else.\"
Up ahead is a bar and across the street from it is an underground mine.
I need to do a scan first, as requested by the Captain.
\"Okay, so we need a doctor to come back to the ship,\" says Finnian. \"D'ya think they'll just come because Alexandra is hurt? That would make it sort of a house call, wouldn't it? I don't know if doctors on this moon do house calls.\"\n
\"I don't think we should bring up payment until whoever we find does, \" says the Captain. \"And if they do, let's let them throw out a number first.\"\n
\"Ah-ha!\" exclains Finnian. \"So good to be on the other side of your negotiations for a chance. I see how it goes now. This mystery doc will be lucky to have an eighth share.\"\n
\"None of you are at an eighth of a share,\" replies the Captain.\n
\"The robot is. Hey robot, you getting an eighth of a share?\"\n
\"No,\" says Mr Mailx.\n
\"There ya go. Too bad you look like three poorly stacked Commodores. If the type of machine you were was a Rug Doctor the Captain might have paid you for this.\" Finnian waves his hands. \"All of this.\"\n
I see now that we landed in just an enormous flat crater -- the crater's edge is just beyond this little section of town. I still have no idea where anyone around here lives. I'm hoping their homes are out of the crater and they all get around by jetpack. (There is what appears to be an abandoned snowmobile close by with tracks leading to the bar, so maybe it's just that.) To the east is the actual center of town.
I'm inside the far edge of a crater here on Enceladus. The crater's walls are visible now, maybe no more than another kilometer. The whole moon is only a quarter the size of Ethiopia, where I grew up. A disused snowmobile lies a bit away, to the east is the hot sauce bar and the entrance to a mine.
Center of Town
There is a large log cabin to the south. Pretty rustic. Trees don't exactly grow here, so the fact that it exists at all means that someone really wanted to have an earthly experience. To the north is a cave, my scan indicated that people can descend downwards.\n
\"I can do the talking once we g-- \" starts Finnian.\n
\"I'll do the talking,\" interrupts the Captain.\n
\"I'll try the milder hot sauces,\" I add, helpfully.
The Captain walks over to what I thought was a broken and useless snowmobile. She breaks open a panel underneath the steering mechanism and holds two wires together. Nothing happens. She rolls her eyes and gives it a push down the snowy hill leading to the hot sauce bar... only she goes straight past the bar and descends out of sight.\n
Twenty seconds later I hear a roar.\n
Ten seconds after that, I see her come back up the hill with the now-working snowmobile.\n
\"Get on, let's go,\" she says to me.
The Captain sees Finnian, Mr Mailx and Doctor Nahas about to leave.\n
\"You're all set?\" she asks Finnian.\n
\"Yeah, we're huffing it back to the Plagoo.\"\n
\"I need Mr Mailx, but I have a suspicion that Grimes programmed it to not listen to women,\" she adds. Nahas looks at the two of them like they are crazy.\n
\"He ... Grimes told me why he did it. He didn't do it because of anything other than he didn't want his fiancee back on Earth to have it open up his stash of --\" I make the 'cut him off' gesture at Finnian and look towards the Doctor. Him getting weirded out is the last thing we need.\n
\"His, ah, stash of um ... er ... women's socks,\" says Finnian, finally. The fact that it took him ten seconds to come up with something worse than if he just told the truth isn't helping. \"Do you need the robot, Cap? Mailx, go with the Captain,\" says Finnian.\n
\"Okay,\" says Mailx. Finnian and the Doctor each head back to the Plagoo.
To the south is a Hot Sauce bar. To the west is the snow path leading to the Plagoo. To the north is a mine.
I can't go that way just yet. Valid exits are to the south and west.
Hot Sauce Bar
The four of us enter the bar and we're greeted by a doorman. He is suited up in a caribou skin and fur coat. I don't think it was made for him as he's sitting on a stool and the thing falls all over the floor of the bar like a wedding dress.\n
\"You can't bring that thing in here,\" says the bouncer, but he is pointing to Finnian. Mr Mailx turns his entire body to face Finnian, which is the creepiest thing ever because of how long it takes him to do that on tread.\n
\"That's my pilot,\" says the Captain.\n
\"There's one room and a bathroom in here, you'll be able make your way around just fine,\" says the bouncer. \"Get that cap out of here before I throw you all out myself.\"\n
\"Oh, it's the cap?\" asks Finnian. \"This thing is the height of fashion far back around the outer moons of Saturn.\" The Captain looks skyward.\n
\"This is a moon of Saturn, dummy,\" says the bouncer.\n
Finnian looks genuinely surprised at that revelation. \"Huh,\" he says.\n
\"Mailx, please go with Finnian and wait outside the bar,\" says the Captain.\n
\"No!\" shrieks the robot.\n
\"Come on, robot,\" Finnian says to Mr Mailx. The two of them leave, to presumably wait outside or try to find a print encyclopedia to assert the correctness of the bouncer's claim.\n
Now that we're inside, this looks just like any other bar in the solar system, except colder and with a scent of chile peppers instead of old hops. There are a series of booths around the walls with the bar itself a square right in the middle. I'd say there's probably thirty or forty men, women and robots in here.\n
The Captain points to a couple empty stools near the plastic bin of lemons and limes. \"Shall we?\" she asks.
The bar doesn't look that much different than normal alcohol bars across the solar system. It's got a bit more rustic feel because they had to make it out of logs, but it adds some charm, I guess. The bar itself is in the middle of the room, and there are shelves here with different kinds of hot sauces, arranged by color, manufacturer, scoville rating and how many people they've made puke up. The lights are fairly low 
and we don't have a lot of time to try to find a doctor.
and I'm ready to get out of here for the most part.
The only exit that I can see out of here is to the north.
I can't leave yet, I have to help find a doctor.
Mine Entrance
\"How did you get the key, anyway?\" I ask the Captain.\n
\"When you were flailing about, I just explained the situation to her and promised her no more theatrics. I guess the mine is owned by the same company that owns the hot sauce bar. I guess they own everything around here.\"\n
\"Well, they are doing a great job, they put in air, they put in a little more gravity, they put in... well...\" I can't really think of what else this company did to make it nice here.\n
\"Yeah,\" says the Captain, out of compliments for Enceladus as well. \"I think we might be the only people in a decade to land here as opposed to crash land here and be stuck.\"
The mine descends deep into the belly of the moon, but standing before us at the moment is a formidable door.
Looks like a reinforced metal door, about five feet tall so we'll have to duck under a little.
Mine
\"So we need some metal for patching up the ship,\" says the Captain, just reiterating the plan. I don't quite know how a chunk of metal is going to help, but then it's unlikely to be my job to fix it, anyway. This area of the mine extends about fifteen feet north. There is a (wooden) beam overhead and a rope leading downwards.\n
\"Shouldn't there be a cart or something to get us along?\" I ask.\n
Mr Mailx moves slowly to the edge of the hole. \"There, Is, One, Aaaaah,\" he says, having gotten a little too close to the edge, and fallen. The Captain just shakes her head.\n
\"Let's go get him,\" she says with a sigh.
This is a makeshift antechamber, the best they can do here. There is snow on top of us and at all sides. The snow is very compact and hard. Igloo-like, maybe? We can travel downwards if we wanted to.
We can go down into the mine ... and we can go south back to town.
I'd rather not head down there again.
Mine Level Two
The Captain and I, having descended from the rope above, come to rest on this level of the mine.\n
We don't really see any metal that can help us out here. It also appears that there hasn't been much digging, as if there was something interesting further down, but they wanted a base here in case of future expansion. The rope continues to lead downwards. There is some installed blue neon lighting below that I can see. It appears that there's just one more level to the mine.
\nThe Captain continues by going down.
We can only go down from here.
We can't go that way by ourselves.
Mine Level Three
Luckily, the rope is close enough to the sides of the mine that I can sort of steady myself and kick until I descend completely.\n
The mine shaft ends here, in terms of going into the center of Enceladus. Carved out from the rock and snow is a path to the east.

There's an exit east of where we are now. Entering the mine cart can also, in theory, bring us up.
We can't go that way by ourselves.
I can't go that way. 
Bottom of Mine
We have come to the bottom of the mine and the farthest anyone has dug. Nothing allows any further passage.\n
It's a bit dark, although there is some neon rope providing a bit of light. There is icy rock on all sides of us.
We are in the bottom of the mine here in the city. A small piece of neon rope that is powered from who-knows-what gives us a little bit of light, but that's it, really. It's cold in here as we are surrounded by icy rock on all sides.
I don't really get anything back and the moment that is interesting. Not right now, anyway.
I take a quick scan of the area. This boulder is definitely pure ice, nothing else to it as far as I can tell. The only issue is that the ice is harder than anything I can imagine and we have a giant chunk of it in front of us.
\nI... okay, I do find something interesting in the mine itself, however, a vein of silver ore about the size of a baseball, just half an inch from the side of the northern wall. Covered in much more supple icy snow, I dig at it until it almost pops out and ends up on the ground. I pick it up. I have no idea if the Captain is aware of what I just did, I should definitely talk to her about it.
I don't get anything interesting in the scan.
We're stuck here unless we can figure out a way to get past the boulder.
There is an exit west.
There is an exit west.
I can't go that way at the moment, I don't want to leave the Captain.
We can't go that way due to the cave-in.
Rec Room
The Recreation Room of the Plagoo is twenty feet by fifteen feet and placed way in the 'back' of the ship. I think the theory for the designer of the class of ship that the Plagoo is, is that we'd constantly have people firing weapons at us, so put the least important thing towards the tail. We are all gathered here. I am the last to arrive and overhear the Captain talk about how we can process the aluminum until we can get to a shipyard with Finnian while asking Doctor Nahas to help with arrangements for Grimes's body.\n
The Captain sees that I have arrived and gives me a genuinely warm smile, the first I've seen her make in ages. \"I think we just need to all have a drink together after everything that went down,\" she says to all of us.\n
The Captain and Finnian each have a glass of scotch. Doctor Nahas has a ginger ale. Alexandra has an entire bottle of vodka and someone gave Mr Mailx a Dixie Cup with engine oil in it. (He can't actually drink anything, so this was someone's attempt at humanizing him.) Alexandra hands me a drink of my own invention, a gintata.\n
\"To those we miss terribly and to all who remain,\" says the Captain as everyone raises their glass.
This is the rec room of the Plagoo. Everyone here has their glasses raised in a toast, with drinking of said beverage no doubt the next thing everyone does.\n
My friends are here.
